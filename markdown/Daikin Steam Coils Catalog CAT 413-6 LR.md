# **AHRI Certification**

Daikin steam coils are certified in accordance with the forced circulation air cooling and air heating coil certification program, which is based on AHRI Standard 410. To

obtain AHRI certification ratings, it is first necessary to have the testing facilities reviewed for proper instrumentation, control and accuracy of test data. A coil is then submitted to an AHRI approved independent testing facility for comparative tests. AHRI then approves the coil manufacturer's testing facilities. After the testing facilities are approved, the coil is tested over a wide range of operating conditions. All rating data is the reviewed by AHRI engineers for accuracy and confirmation that procedures established by AHRI have been followed. Periodic check lists of production coils by AHRI, on a random basis, assures compliance with AHRI standards.

**NOTE:** Special application coils may be outside the scope of AHRI Standard 410.

# *HI-F Means High Efficiency*

A principal factor governing fin heat transfer efficiency is the boundary layer film of air adhering to any fin surface. This boundary layer insulates the fin, severely reducing the rate of heat exchange. The advanced rippled-corrugated HI-F design creates a state of continuous turbulence which effectively reduces the boundary layer formation. The exclusive rippled edge instantly deflects the incoming air to create initial turbulence. A succession of corrugations across the fin depth, in conjunction with the staggered tubes, increases the turbulating effect and eliminates the "dead spots" behind the tubes. In this manner, the HI-F design establishes a new high in heat transfer efficiency yielding sharply increased performance. The rippled fin edge also strengthens the fin edge and provides a pleasing overall appearance.

# *E-F Means Energy Efficient*

The term "energy efficient," which is used to describe how well a system utilizes energy, has become a common expression in the HVAC industry.

With costs of energy rising, the need for cutting operating expenses is apparent. Lowering the air pressure drop across the face of the coil will reduce the fan brake horsepower requirement and fan motor electrical demand. The need to cut operating energy expenses is met by the E-F fin surface. The smoother fin design of the E-F surface results in lower operating costs over the life of the equipment.

## *Staggered Tube Design For High Performance*

The more moving air in contact with the tubes in the coil, the more performance obtained from the total available surface. The staggered tube design exposes the tubes to more moving air than the in-line design. The geometry of the staggered tube design also allows the rows to be spaced closer together. This results in a more compact coil providing higher capacities.

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Design Features**

# *Patented Fin Designs*

The HI-F and E-F fin surfaces give the flexibility needed to perform at optimum efficiency. Seamless drawn copper tubes are mechanically expanded into full drawn, die-formed fin collars to provide positive metal-to-metal contact for high heat transfer efficiency and long coil life.

# *Pitched in the Casing*

The specially designed casing automatically provides the proper pitch for positive condensate removal resulting in reduced installation and expense. Supply and return connections are properly sized for each coil to assure optimal distribution and proper condensate removal.

# *Brazed Copper Tubes-to-Copper Header Joint*

Seamless copper tubes brazed into heavy-gauge seamless drawn copper headers. This combination of similar metals eliminates unequal thermal expansion and greatly reduces stress in the tube-header joint. Intruded tube holes in the header allow an extra large mating area for increased strength and flexibility designed to provide many years of trouble-free service.

# *Free Floating Core*

One of the most important requirements of a steam coil design is to allow for thermal expansion without creating stress and wear on the tubes.

To provide for this requirement, the coil core must be free to expand and contract within the casing without inducing wear on the tubes. A special coil casing has been designed in which the coil core is free to float in a recessed fin channel. Since the core is not supported by the tubes there is no resultant tube wear. The recessed fin channel prevents air bypass while adding structural support to the casing.

<span id="page-6-0"></span># **Steam Circuiting Arrangements**

Select Hl-F5, E-F5 and HI-F8 steam coils from three different circuiting arrangements: the general purpose 5SA coil, and two jet tube steam distributing styles-5JA, 8JA and 8RA coilsintended for both general and special purpose heating. While each of these arrangements has been carefully designed to serve a particular area in steam coil application, sufficient similarities are present in design and performance to render them interchangeable in many cases. Optimal fin design provides a high performing heat transfer surface while a host of exclusive features provide extended coil life.

# *5SA & 5HA General Purpose Steam Coils*

5SA and high pressure 5HA steam coils are specifically designed for economical general purpose heating. Featuring high quality and high capacity, they are an ideal choice for all regular steam applications - heating, reheating, booster and process use.

The sectional diagram illustrates the steam circuiting of this single tube design. A perforated plate type steam baffle directly behind the supply connection ensures even steam pressure across the entire header length. Inlet tube orifices meter a uniform flow of steam into each tube.

# *5JA, 8JA, 5GA & 8GA Jet Tube Distributing Coils*

5JA, 8JA and high pressure 5GA and 8GA jet tube steam distributing coils are excellent for any general purpose heating application. With the superior freeze resistance provided by the tube-within-a-tube construction, they are ideal for low temperature preheating and special process applications.

The construction, as illustrated, features directional orificed inner tubes, a unique elliptical supply header located inside the heavy-duty return header and a circuiting arrangement which provides both supply and return connections at the same end of the coil.

## *8RA & 8TA Opposite End Connection Jet Tube Distributing Coils*

8RA and high pressure 8TA jet tube steam distributing coils are very similar in design and operation to the "JA" coils except that supply and return connections are located on opposite ends.

#### **Directional Orifices**

The directional orifices properly meter steam along the entire tube length to assure a consistent temperature rise across the full coil face and accelerate condensate removal. This important feature is standard on all of our jet tube steam distributing coils.

**Coil Selection and Application**

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Coil Selection Considerations**

Because we offer a wide variety of steam coil types, materials and fin spacings, you can obtain a very accurate selection. To obtain proper selection of each coil, the following variables should be considered.

# *Entering Air Temperature*

Two basic types of steam coils are offered - the single tube steam coil and the jet distributing tube steam coil.

The single tube steam coil, type 5SA, is generally more economical when applied in an above freezing environment. When the entering air is near or below freezing, the jet distributing tube steam coils, types 5JA or 8JA, should be selected to provide maximum resistance to coil freeze-up.

# *Leaving Air Temperature*

The selection of a coil to deliver a desired leaving air temperature is relatively simple, as it involves only dry bulb temperatures and sensible heating. Steam coils may be accurately selected to deliver the desired leaving air temperature by varying the fin series and number of rows deep. In the interest of coil economy, the higher fin series should be used in place of additional rows deep. However, in some instances, the system air pressure drop and/or condensate loading may dictate the use of a lower fin series and more rows deep.

**NOTE:** Oversized steam coils can present a control problem. Coils should be sized as accurately as possible.

# *Operating Steam Pressures*

Standard steam coil construction is designed to withstand operating pressures up to 150 psig and give very satisfactory service. However, the primary factors in coil life are erosive and corrosive actions, both of which are greatly accelerated with increased steam pressures. Corrosive action may be partially controlled by using compounds that will maintain the proper pH in the system. However, the best protection to prolong coil life is to use heavy-duty high pressure steam coil construction. Although high pressure construction is not necessary up to 150 psig, it is highly recommended for longer coil life and coil economy when operating steam pressures exceed 25 psig.

# *Air Volume (CFM)*

The CFM to be handled will be determined by the consideration of the installation. The coil size selected must be capable of handling the total CFM at face velocities (FPM) acceptable to the heating application. Face velocities may range from 200 to 1500 FPM with 600 to 700 FPM a common design range.

When the specified air volume is not at standard air conditions, 70°F and sea level, the CFM must be corrected, as [Conversion](#page-11-1)  [of Air Volume to Standard Air on page 12,](#page-11-1) before using the curves and tables in this catalog.

# *Lowering Airside Pressure Drop*

The E-F5 fin is designed to lower the air pressure drop from 20% to 30% for a given application. Although more surface may be necessary to maintain capacity, the cost can be amortized by the lower fan brake horsepower requirements. The payback may be realized in just a few months.

# *Freezing Conditions*

When the entering air to the coil is below freezing, the use of coils in series airflow and the correct control system is the best protection against coil freeze-up. In such a system, the first coil in the direction of airflow would use a two-position control valve that would open to full steam pressure (5 psig minimum) whenever the outside air temperature drops below freezing and would be capable of raising the entering air from the minimum expected outside temperature to at least 35° F. The second coil would use a modulating control valve and would raise the entering air up to the final required leaving air temperature. By using this type of system, the first coil could not freeze, because it would always be in full operation when the entering air temperature is below 35°F. The second coil could not freeze because the entering air temperature would always be above 35°F.

For ease of control and maximum freeze protection, the use of an additional preheat coil is recommended when the entering air temperature is expected to drop well below freezing. In such a system, the first coil would be the smallest and would open at 35°F. The second coil would open at about 10°F to 15°F outside air temperature, depending on the capacity of the first coil. A third coil would be modulated to obtain the final leaving air temperature.

In calculating the air temperature rise through the second and third coil, the leaving air temperature off the first coil is used as the entering air temperature to the second coil, etc.

For additional recommendations regarding freezing conditions, refer to [Freezing Conditions on page 22.](#page-21-1)

# *Individual Installation Requirements*

Each installation will have its own particular requirements. Normally one of the wide variety of our steam coils will conveniently fill these requirements without modification.

If the application is to be zoned, the uniform air temperature distribution of types 5JA, 8JA and 8RA makes these coils well suited.

Where problems such as special controls, atmosphere contamination, special process applications, etc., indicate the need for a special coil, contact your local representative. This individual welcomes the opportunity to assist you.

## *TR/ITD Method:*

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathsf{T}. & \mathsf{Determine } \mathsf{T}\mathsf{R}\mathsf{U}\mathsf{T}\mathsf{D} :\\ \mathsf{T}\mathsf{R} & = \ \mathsf{L}\mathsf{v}\mathsf{g}. \mathsf{Air} \mathsf{ - Ent.} \mathsf{Air} = \ \underline{\mathsf{B}\mathsf{T}\mathsf{U}\mathsf{H}} \end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{\(\uparrow.030,000\)} & = & \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\text{\(\uparrow.07\)}\)} \\ \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)}\)} & = & \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)}\)} \\ \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)}\)} & = & \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)} \\ \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)}\)} & = & \text{\(\uparrow.09\*.\)} \end{array}$$

ITD = Sat. Steam Temp. - Ent. Air Temp.

Sat. Steam Temp. = 239.4 ([Table 3 on page 19](#page-18-1))

$$\text{TBRITD} = \frac{70}{239.4 \text{ (-10)}} = 0.287$$

2. Initial Selection

Enter [Figure 4](#page-12-1) at 800 FPM to determine which coil meets or exceeds a TR/ITD of 0.281. A 5SA1001C coil has a TR/lTD of 0.292.

3. Determine Condensate Loading Factor (FL)

$$\begin{array}{l} \text{Condensate } \mathsf{Loedy} = \frac{\mathsf{BTU} \mathsf{H}}{\mathsf{Lentent } \mathsf{Heat} \times \mathsf{Tubes} \mathsf{Feed}} \\\\ \text{Latent } \mathsf{Heat} = \mathsf{952.6 (Table 2, page 16)} \\\\ \mathsf{Tubes } \mathsf{Feed} = \mathsf{24 (Table 3, page 16)} \\\\ \frac{\mathsf{3,830,000}}{\mathsf{952.6} \times \mathsf{24}} \end{array}$$

Enter [Figure 7](#page-15-1) at 80.0 lbs./hr./tube and 10 psig to find FL = 0.995.

4. Final Selection

*Actual TR / ITD = 0.292 × 0.995 = 0.290 (greater than 0.281) Final Selection: 5SA1001C - 36 × 120* 

5. Air Pressure Drop

Refer to [Figure 10](#page-16-1) and find air pressure drop of 0.37" H20.

6. Determine Actual Condensate Loading

*Actual TR = 0.290 × [239.4 (-10)] = 72.3 Actual BTUH = (1.09) (24,000) (72.3) = 1,892,000 Actual Condensate Load = BTUH Latent Heat 1,892,000 = 1986 Lb. / Hr. 952.6*

7. Determine Actual Leaving Air Temperature *Actual Lvg. Air Temp. = Ent. Air Temp. + TR = (-10) + 72.3 = 62.3°F*

<span id="page-10-0"></span>#### *Base Temperature Rise Method:*

1. Determine Air Temperature Rise

$$\text{TFR} = \frac{\text{BTUH}}{\text{T}.09 \times \text{CFM}} = \frac{\text{T}.830,000}{\text{T}.09 \times \text{24},000} = \text{T}0\text{°F}$$

2. Determine Steam Conversion Factor (FS)

*FS = 1.098 ([Table 2 on page 19\)](#page-18-2)* 

3. Determine Condensate Loading Factor (FL) *Condensate Loading = BTUH Latent Heat × Tubes Fed*

*Latent Heat = 952.6 ([Table 3 on page 19](#page-18-1))* 

Assume 1-row coil. If 1-row coil does not meet required capacity, the following steps should be repeated for a 2-row coil:

4. Determine Base Temperature Rise Required

*Base Temp. Rise Required = Air Temp. Rise FT × FL* 

 *70 = 64.1°F 1.098 × 0.995*

5. Coil Selection

Enter [Figure 4](#page-12-1) at 800 FPM to determine which coil meets or exceeds a base temperature of 64.1°F. A 5SA1001C coil has a base temperature of 66.2°F. Final Selection: 5SA1001C - 36 × 120.

6. Air Pressure Drop

Refer to [Figure 10](#page-16-1) and find air pressure drop of 0.37" H20.

7. Actual Condensate Loading

*Actual BTUH (1.09) (24,000) (72.3) = 1,892,000* 

*Actual Condensate Load = BTUH Latent Heat* 

*1,892,000 = 1986 lb/hr. 952.6*

## **General Formulas**

```
1. BTUH:
```
*BTUH = 1.09 × CFM × Temperature Rise Where:*

*1.09 = 0.242 × 60 × 0.075 0.242 = Sp. Ht. of Air at 70°F 60 = Min. / Hr. 0.075 = Density Std. Air in Lbs. / Cu.Ft. Temp. Rise = Lvg. Air Temp. - Ent. Air Temp.* 

2. Temperature Rise (TR):

*TR = BTUH 1.09 × CFM* 

- 3. Leaving Air Temperature *Lvg. Air Temp. = Ent. Air Temp. + Temp. Rise*
- 4. Initial Temperature Difference (ITD): *ITD = Ent. Water Temp. - Ent. Air Dry Bulb*
- 5. Face Velocity (FPM):
	- *FPM = CFM Face Area (Sq. Ft.)*
- 6. Pounds Condensate:

*Lbs. Cond. / Hr. = BTUH Latent Heat of Steam* 

7. Condensate Loading:

*Lbs. Cond./Hr./Tube = BTUH Latent Heat of Steam × No. Tubes Fed*

<span id="page-11-0"></span># <span id="page-11-1"></span>**Conversion of Air Volume to Standard Air**

When the specified air volume (CFM) is given at any temperature other than sea level, these charts should be used for correction before using the capacity and pressure drop tables which are based 1.20 on CFM at standard air conditions.

#### **Example:**

To convert 15,900 CFM of air at 95°F and at 3,000 feet altitude to standard conditions:

#### *CFM of Standard Air*

- *= (CFM of Specified Air × FT × FA )*
- *= 15,900 × 0.955 × 0.896*
- *= 13.600*

*Where:* 

- *FT = Temperature Conversion Factor*
- *FA = Altitude Conversion Factor*

The CFM of standard air should be used to determine face velocity through the coil, which in turn is used to determine heat transfer values, and the air pressure drop through the coil.

The air pressure drop value taken from [Figure 10](#page-16-1), [Figure](#page-16-2)  [11](#page-16-2), and [Figure 12](#page-17-0) must be converted to altitude to be used for static pressure calculations. To convert the air pressure drop from standard air at sea level to the air pressure drop at altitude use the following equation:

```
Pressure Drop = Pressure Drop at Sea Level
at Altitude FT × FA
```

**Piping Data**

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Application Recommendations**

Satisfactory operation and service are best provided when coils are installed with proper piping, trap, and support arrangement. The following notes and diagrams are recommended.

# **General**

- 1. Provide separate supports and hangers for the coil and for the piping.
- 2. Be certain that adequate piping flexibility is provided. Stresses resulting from expansion of closely coupled piping and coil arrangement can cause serious damage. Coils having opposite end connections must be piped with expansion joints.
- 3. Standard coils are pitched in the casings when installed for horizontal airflow. The installation should be checked to ensure that the casing is level. On vertical airflow applications, the coils must be pitched when installed.
- 4. Do not reduce pipe size at the coil return connection. Carry return connection size through the dirt pocket, making the reduction at the branch leading to the trap.
- 5. Install vacuum breakers on all applications to prevent retaining condensate in the coil. Generally, the vacuum breaker is to be connected between the coil inlet and the return main, as shown. However, for a system with a flooded return main, the vacuum breaker should be open to the atmosphere and the trap design should allow venting of large quantities of air.
- 6. Do not drip supply mains through the coil.
- 7. Do not attempt to lift condensate when using modulating or ON-OFF control.

# **Controls**

- 1. With coils arranged for series airflow, a separate control is required on each bank, or coil, in the direction of airflow.
- 2. On high pressure installations, a two-position steam valve with a face and bypass arrangement is preferred where modulating control is required.
- 3. Modulating valves must be sized properly. DO NOT UNDERSIZE.

# **Traps**

- 1. Size traps in accordance with trap manufacturer's recommendations. Be certain that the required differential will always be available. DO NOT UNDERSIZE.
- 2. Float and thermostatic or bucket traps are recommended for low pressure steam. On high pressure systems, bucket traps are normally recommended. The thermostatic traps should be used only for air venting.
- 3. Bucket traps are recommended for use with ON-OFF control only.
- 4. Locate traps at least 12 inches below the coil return connection.
- 5. Multiple coil installation:
	- a. Each coil or group of coils that is individually controlled must be individually trapped.
	- b. Coils in series separate traps are required for each coil, or bank of coils, in series.
	- c. Coils in parallel a single trap may generally be used but an individual trap for each coil is preferred.

# <span id="page-21-1"></span>**Freezing Conditions**

## *(Entering air temperatures below 35°F)*

- 1. 5JA, 8JA and 8RA coils are definitely recommended.
- 2. 5 psi steam must be supplied to coils at all times.
- 3. Modulating valves are not recommended. Control should be by means of face and bypass dampers.
- 4. Consideration should be given to the use of two or three coils in series with two-position steam control valves on that coil or coils which will be handling 35°F or colder air. The desired degree of control can be attained with a modulating valve on the downstream coil.
- 5. Provision should always be made to thoroughly mix fresh air and return air before it enters coil. Also, temperature control elements must be properly located to obtain true air mixture temperatures.
- 6. As additional protection against freeze-up, the trap should be installed sufficiently far below coil to provide an adequate hydrostatic head to help remove of condensate during an interruption in the steam pressure. Estimate 3 feet for each 1 psi of trap differential required.
- 7. On startup, admit steam to coil ten minutes before admitting outdoor air.
- 8. Provisions must be made to close fresh air dampers if steam supply pressure falls below minimum specified.
