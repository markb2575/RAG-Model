**Introduction**

# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Daikin Energy Recovery Systems**

Our energy recovery device transfers both heat and moisture energy between the exhaust and ventilation air. In doing so, it conditions the incoming ventilation air. This total energy device offers a cost-effective and efficient method for containing energy costs while meeting the ventilation requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-1999.

# **Factory-Installed and Tested Package**

Daikin energy recovery systems are provided as a one-piece, factory-installed and tested package. The package includes an AHRI certified enthalpy wheel, exhaust fan with VFD, prefilters, and, for economizer applications, optional bypass dampers and controls (see [Figure 1](#page-2-1)). This helps to eliminate field coordination and leakage problems associated with field installation.

The outdoor and exhaust air flows are arranged in counterflow for better efficiency, and to reduce field cleaning requirements. Exhaust contaminants cannot enter the ventilation air because the exhaust air static pressure is always less than the ventilation air static pressure. Frost protection and purge options are also available.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Energy Savings**

Daikin energy wheels normally recover 70–75% both sensible and latent energy. The result can be considerable energy savings:

- They provide twice as much summer energy recovery as sensible only alternatives such as plate frame heat exchangers and run-around loops.
- Energy recovery increases the air conditioning capacity by 25% if minimum outdoor air design is 33%. Therefore, a 75 ton unit with energy recovery provides about 90 tons of cooling capacity. The cost savings on mechanical heating and cooling components offset the additional cost of energy recovery.
- Winter humidification energy costs may be cut up to 60%.
- Winter latent energy recovery lowers the dew point of exhaust air, compared to sensible only alternatives and allows frost-free operation to lower ambient temperatures.

# **Satisfies ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Energy Recovery Requirements**

- ASHRAE 90.1-2004 usually requires energy recovery if the design requires more than 5000 total CFM and more than 70% minimum outdoor air.
- The Daikin energy recovery effectiveness exceeds ASHRAE 90.1-2004 requirements.

# **A Complete, Factory-Tested Package**

### **Outdoor and Return Air Prefilters**

2" pre-filters are provided in both the outdoor and return air, to minimize the need for cleaning the wheel.

### **AHRI and UL Conformance**

The Daikin energy recovery wheel is AHRI certified for performance and UL recognized for safety.

### **Integrated Cooling, Heating and Recovery Control**

Mechanical heating and cooling are supplied as necessary to supplement the wheel and maintain space conditions.

# **Free Cooling**

Units with economizers include bypass dampers that are opened when "free cooling" is available. The wheel is simultaneously turned OFF.

### **Proper Exhaust**

Exhaust fan speed is controlled for proper exhaust, using a factory installed Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) and space building pressure sensor.

# **Enthalpy Wheel Design**

The unique composition of the Daikin energy wheel (see [Figure 2](#page-3-1)) provides significant advantages. Composed of synthetic fiber, it allows moisture-absorbing desiccant to be uniformly and permanently dispersed throughout the wheel, maximizing its life expectancy. The desiccant forms a molecular sieve that attracts water and minimizes contamination. The honeycombed design and small aperture sizes of our wheel provide even air flow and minimize internal wheel bypass - unlike other energy recovery wheels that can separate or be spread apart by air flow and risk contamination of ventilation air from the exhaust air. Other benefits include:

- Homogenous media not coated or bonded and will not delaminate
- Synthetic wheel media is completely corrosion resistant
- Unitary wheel construction maximizes face flatness
- Fluted geometry minimizes internal cross leakage
- Molecular sieve desiccant reduces cross contamination
- Wheel is completely water washable

### **Cassette Design**

- Heavy duty galvanized steel construction with removable side panels
- No-maintenance bearings standard on small cassettes
- Flanged outboard bearings used on larger cassettes
- Full contact brush seals minimize leakage
- AC drive motor with Power Twist link belt
- Optional variable speed drive motor available
- Adjustable purge section, provided as standard, reduces cross-contamination

# **Return/Exhaust Air Fan**

A return/exhaust air fan is provided in a typical exhaust fan configuration. This allows the exhaust to be at a lower pressure than the OA intake and minimizes cross-contamination. However, this fan has characteristics of both a return air fan (RAF) and an exhaust air fan (EAF).

- EAF characteristic It only exhausts air and must be sized to handle return duct APD at maximum exhaust cfm.
- RAF characteristic It always operates whenever the SAF operates and the SAF does not need to be sized for the return duct APD.
- RAF characteristic The fan will do an excellent job of preventing positive building pressure because it draws a large negative at the return of the unit.

The EAF/RAF must be controlled by building pressure. This control is included with the MicroTech® II controls option.

# **Handling Moisture**

Low space humidity is a common problem in the winter and can cause both discomfort and health problems for tenants. It also leads to increased static electricity, which can be damaging to computer equipment. However, mechanical humidification requires 1,100 btu per pound of humidity. Our energy recovery system provides the added benefit of significantly raising the humidity level of outdoor air in the winter. Not only can this have a dramatic impact on the first cost and operating cost of an HVAC system, it can also dramatically improve indoor air quality and comfort for building occupants.

# **Summer Performance**

Enthalpy wheels provide twice as much summer energy recovery as sensible devices because summer ventilation air involves as much latent load as sensible load. In fact, our wheel normally cools outdoor air down to 67°F wet bulb.

<span id="page-5-0"></span># **First Cost and Operating Cost Reductions**

The charts below illustrate typical energy cost savings from the Daikin RoofPak Energy Recovery System. First cost savings result because the system is factory-installed and tested, eliminating the need for field design, installation and coordination. Because less mechanical cooling is needed, the cooling system can be downsized for additional first cost savings. This also can reduce the unit's electrical requirement, further reducing installed costs.

# **Two Arrangements Offered**

Daikin offers two energy recovery arrangements:

- 1. Make-Up Air unit (up to 16,000 cfm): SAF supplies 100% outside air and all return air is exhausted (see [Figure 5\)](#page-5-1).
- 2. Economizer unit (up to 30,000 total cfm and 16,000 cfm of outdoor air): SAF supplies minimum or economizer outside (mixed) air and some return air is exhausted (see [Figure 6](#page-5-2)).

*Figure 6: Energy Recovery Economizer Arrangement* 

<span id="page-5-2"></span>

6------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Parallel Air Paths on Energy Recovery Wheel Applications**

### **Economizer Units**

There are three sets or parallel air flow paths on economizer units:

### *Set 1: OA and RA paths to the SAF*

- 1. The OA path APD is normally greater than the RA path APD. Therefor, the air balancer must adjust the RA dampers to not open fully so that sufficient OA is achieved.
- 2. The RA path includes return duct ESP. Normally, the SAF handles both of these paths. Therefore, the EAF need not handle the return duct ESP. However:
	- The RA path is not open during economizer operation, so the EAF must handle return duct ESP during economizer operation or excessive positive building pressure will occur.
	- For VAV units, note that RA cfm during economizer operation normally is less that design return cfm.
	- An energy analysis must be careful not to overwhelm the EAF with return duct ESP except during economizer cooling.

### *Set 2: OA Wheel and OA Bypass Path to the SAF*

### *Set 3: EA Wheel and Bypass Path to the EAF*

### **100% Outdoor Air Units**

There are no parallel flow paths in a 100% OA unit. Instead, there is one counter-flow path (OA and EA paths throughout the wheel). The EAF must be sized for design return duct cfm and ESP.

### *Figure 7: Parallel Air Paths*

7------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Enthalpy Wheel Controls and Wiring**

### **Drive Motor**

The enthalpy wheel comes with a constant speed, standard drive motor.

# **Frost Protection Option**

The frost protection option includes the following:

- VFD to vary the speed of the energy recovery wheel (ERW)
- MicroTech II controls and sensors

Frosting can occur when EA is saturated and OAT is below 32°F ([Figure 8\)](#page-7-1). MicroTech II senses the RA temperature and humidity, as well at OAT, and determines if frost can occur. If so, the wheel is slowed down so that the wheel LAT is not saturated.

Dry Bulb Temperature

# **Energy Recovery Bypass Damper Control**

When a unit is equipped with a 0–100% modulating economizer, the energy recovery option includes a set of bypass dampers that allow air to bypass the energy recovery wheel when the wheel is not operating. The dampers are driven closed for 2 minutes whenever the energy recovery wheel is turned on, forcing the entering and leaving air to go through the wheel. When the outdoor dampers are driven more than 3% above the Minimum Outdoor Damper Position Set Point (as when the unit enters the Economizer operating state) the wheel is shut off and the bypass dampers are driven open allowing the entering and leaving air to bypass the wheel.

<span id="page-8-0"></span><span id="page-8-1"></span>**Application Considerations**

# **General**

The following section contains basic application and installation guidelines that must be considered as part of the detailed analysis of any specific project.

Units are intended for use in normal heating, ventilating and air conditioning applications. Consult your local Daikin sales representative for applications involving operation at high ambient temperatures, high altitudes, non-cataloged voltages and for applications requiring modified or special control sequences. Consult your local Daikin sales representative for job specific unit selections that fall outside of the range of the catalog tables, such as 100% outside air applications.

For proper operation, units should be rigged in accordance with instructions stated in the unit installation manual (IM). Fire dampers, if required, must be installed in the ductwork according to local or state codes. No space is allowed for these dampers in the unit.

Follow factory check, test and start procedures explicitly to achieve satisfactory start-up and operation (see [IM 738\)](http://salesportal.daikinapplied.com/iseprise/EpriseFilterExt.dll/main/Biz/home/homepage?).

Most rooftop applications take advantage of the significant energy savings provided with economizer operation. When an economizer system is used, mechanical refrigeration is typically not required below an ambient temperature of 50°F. Standard RoofPak refrigeration systems are designed to operate in ambient temperatures down to 45°F. For applications where an economizer system cannot be used, Daikin's SpeedTrol™ head pressure control system is available on size 045C to 075C units to permit operation down to 0°F. However, if the condenser coils are not properly shielded from the wind, the minimum ambient conditions stated above must be raised.

# **Unit Location**

The structural engineer must verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Take extreme caution when using a wooden roof structure.

Locate the unit fresh air intakes away from building flue stacks or exhaust ventilators to reduce possible reintroduction of contaminated air to the system. Unit condenser coils should be located to avoid contact with any heated exhaust air.

Allow sufficient space around the unit for maintenance/ service clearance as well as to allow for full outside air intake, removal of exhaust air and for full condenser airflow. Refer to [Recommended Clearances on page 52](#page-51-1) for recommended clearances. Consult your Daikin sales representative if available clearances do not meet minimum recommendations. Where code considerations, such as the NEC, require extended clearances, they take precedence.

In applications utilizing a future cooling unit (RFS), take care in choosing a location of the unit so it will provide proper roof support and service and ventilation clearance necessary for the later addition of a mechanical cooling section (RCS).

# **Split Units**

Units may sometimes have to be split into multiple pieces to accommodate shipping limitations or jobsite lifting limitations. Units exceeding 52 feet in length may need to be split for shipping purposes. Units exceeding the rating of an available crane or helicopter may also need to be split for rigging purposes. Unit can be split at the condensing section or split between the supply fan and heat section. Contact your local Daikin sales representative for more details.

# **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16 in. per foot side to side). A sub-base has to be constructed by the contractor in applications involving pitched roofs. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. Typical curb installation is illustrated in [Roof Curbs on page 49](#page-48-1). In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side.

Applications in geographic areas that are subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

For acoustical considerations, the condensing section is provided with a support rail versus a full perimeter roof curb. When curbs are installed on a built-up roof with metal decking, an inverted 6 in. channel should be provided on both sides of the unit. Acoustical material should be installed over the decking, inside the roof curb. Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking. Apply appropriate acoustical and vibration design practices during the early stages of design to provide noise compatibility with the intended use of the space. Consult your Daikin sales representative for unit sound power data.

<span id="page-9-0"></span># **Acoustical Considerations**

Good acoustical design is a critical part of any installation and should start at the earliest stages in the design process. Each of the four common sound paths for rooftop equipment must be addressed. These are:

- Radiated sound through the bottom of the unit bottom (air handling section and condensing section) and into the space
- Structure-borne vibration from the unit to the building
- Airborne sound through the supply air duct
- Airborne sound through the return air duct

Locating rooftop equipment away from sound sensitive areas is critical and the most cost effective means of avoiding sound problems. If possible, rooftop equipment should always be located over less sensitive areas such as corridors, toilet facilities or auxiliary spaces and away from office areas, conference rooms and classrooms.

Some basic guidelines for good acoustical performance are:

- Always provide proper structural support under all areas of the unit
- Always locate the unit's center of gravity close to a main support to minimize roof deflection. Maintaining a roof deflection under 1/3 in. minimizes vibration-induced noise
- Use a concrete deck or pad when a unit has to be located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential
- Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking within the curb perimeter, and the openings must be sealed once the duct is installed
- Don't overlook the return air path. Never leave a clear "line of sight" into a return or exhaust fan; always include some duct work (acoustically lined tee) at the return inlet
- Place an acoustical material in the area directly beneath the condensing section
- Select acoustic material that does not encourage microbial growth
- Minimize system static pressure losses to reduce fan sound generation
- Select the appropriate fan for the application. Fans should be selected as close as possible to their peak static efficiency. To assist you, peak static efficiency is identified by the first system curve to the right of the shaded "Do not select" region, as illustrated in [Figure 9](#page-9-1).
- Design duct systems to minimize turbulence
- Account for low frequency duct breakout in system design. Route the first 20 ft. of rectangular duct over non-sensitive areas and avoid large duct aspect ratios. Consider round or oval duct to reduce breakout
- When an added measure of airborne fan sound control is required, sound attenuators can be supplied, factory installed in a unit discharge air section, to treat the supply fan. On the return side, additional attenuation can often be achieved by routing the return duct within the curb area beneath the unit

There are many sound sources in rooftop systems. Fans, compressors, condenser fans, duct take-offs, etc. all generate sound. For guidelines on reducing sound generation in the duct system, refer to the 2003 ASHRAE Applications Handbook, Chapter 47.

Contact your local Daikin sales representative for equipment supply, return and radiated sound power data specific to your application.

#### <span id="page-9-1"></span>*Figure 9: Optimal fan selection line*

10------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-10-0"></span># **Ductwork**

A well-designed duct system is required to allow the rooftop equipment to provide rated performance and to minimize system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow transitions. Avoid any abrupt change in duct size and sharp turns in the fan discharge. Avoid turns opposed to wheel rotation since they generate air turbulence and result in unwanted sound. If 90° turns are necessary, use turning vanes. Refer to the 2003 ASHRAE Applications Handbook, Chapter 47 for specific guidelines relevant to rooftop equipment.

### **Return Duct**

The return path is the most often overlooked. A section of return duct is required to avoid a "line of sight" to the return air opening and to provide attenuation of return air sound. Install an insulated tee with a maximum duct velocity of 1000 to 1200 feet per minute. Extend the duct 15 feet to provide adequate attenuation.

# **Supply Duct**

Insulate supply air ductwork for at least the first 20 feet from the unit. Consider the use of round or oval ductwork, as it significantly reduces low frequency breakout noise near the equipment. If rectangular duct is used, keep the aspect ratio of the duct as low as possible. The large flat surfaces associated with high aspect ratios increase low frequency breakout to the space and can generate noise, such as "oil canning." The maximum recommended supply duct velocity is 1800 to 2000 feet per minute.

## **Duct High Limit**

All Daikin RoofPak systems with VAV control include an adjustable duct high limit switch as a standard feature. This is of particular importance when fast acting, normally closed boxes are used. The switch is field adjustable and must be set to meet the specific rating of the system ductwork.

## **Vibration Isolation**

Make duct attachments to the unit with a flexible connection.

## **Smoke and Fire Protection**

Daikin optionally offers factory-installed outdoor air, return air, and exhaust air dampers as well as smoke detectors in the supply and return air opening, complete with wiring and control. These components often are used in the building's smoke, fume, and fire protection systems. However, due to the wide variation in building design and ambient operating conditions into which our units are applied, we do not represent or warrant that our products are fit and sufficient for smoke, fume, and fire control purposes. The owner and a fully qualified building designer are responsible for meeting all local and NFPA building code requirements with respect to smoke, fume, and fire control. Daikin offers the flexibility to offer these various components and control sequences, as directed by the customer, to help meet code requirements.

# **Filters**

### **General**

Routinely replace filters to minimize filter loading. As filters get dirty, the filter pressure drop increases, causing a decrease in airflow. Depending on fan type, forward curved or airfoil, this airflow change can be significant. The effect of filter loading is the most critical when using 65% and 95% efficient filters.

When making a fan selection, include a pressure drop component in the system total static pressure for filters since they get dirty. Generally, select a value midway between clean and dirty filter ratings. If a minimum airflow is critical, the fan selection should be made using the higher, dirty filter pressure drop value. Following these recommendations should limit airflow fluctuation as the filters load.

### **Final Filters**

The application of final filters (filters downstream of the fan) places special requirements on unit selection. When final filters are employed, cooling coils must be located in the draw-through position so that the filters will not be in a saturated air stream. Also, final filters applications for a unit with gas heat requires the filters to be rated for 500°F. Instruct maintenance personnel to use properly rated replacement filters.

# **Wheel Cleaning**

Daikin energy recovery wheels generally only require periodic and easy cleaning as long as outdoor and return air is relatively clean.

- The counter-flow arrangement causes the wheel to be self-cleaning as long as it rotates
- Daikin provides pre-filters on both the outdoor and return air
- Vacuums or soft brushes should be used to periodically clean the wheel so that dirt does not accumulate and promote microbial growth. Be careful not to force dirt into the interior of the wheel
- If periodic cleaning is forgotten and dirt or mildew persists, then water and mild detergents can be used. However, care must be taken to control the water and keep it out of the floor and other exterior cabinet insulation

<span id="page-11-0"></span># **Variable Air Volume Application**

RoofPak units are available with variable speed drives to provide variable air volume (VAV) control.

In placing a duct static pressure sensor, locate a pressure tap near the end of the main duct trunk. Adjust the static pressure set point so that at minimum airflow all of the terminals receive the minimum static pressure required plus any downstream resistance. Locate the static pressure sensor tap in the ductwork in an area free from turbulence effects and at least ten duct diameters downstream and several duct diameters upstream from any major interference, including branch takeoffs. A second sensor is available and should be used on installations having multiple duct trunks, multiple floors, or significantly varying zones (i.e., east/west). The MicroTech II controller will control the variable speed drive to satisfy the supply duct requiring the most static pressure.

On units with discharge air control, use maximum compressor unloading and hot gas bypass.

# **Fan Operating Range**

The acceptable system operating range of the Daikin rooftop is determined by all of the following characteristics. Each of these limiting factors must be considered for proper performance and component design life.

- Unstable fan operation
- Maximum fan rpm
- Maximum cabinet static pressure
- Maximum face velocity (cooling coil is most important)
- Minimum furnace or electric heater velocity
- Turndown capability on VAV applications
- Compressor operating pressures

[Figure 10](#page-11-1) illustrates these limiting factors with exception of the last two items listed above. The shaded area indicates the design operating range of the fan. For optimal efficiency, select fans as close to the fan's peak static efficiency line as possible. This line is the first system curve to the right of the unstable line illustrated.

All Daikin RoofPak systems feature internally isolated fans. All supply and return air fans are statically and dynamically balanced in the factory and mounted on rubber-in-shear (RIS) or 2 in. deflection spring isolators. Flexible isolation is provided as standard between the fan outlet and the discharge bulkhead to prevent hard contact and vibration transmission. Spring isolated fan assemblies also are available with seismic restraints.

The choice of 2 in. deflection spring isolation or RIS isolation depends on an analysis of the roof structure and whether or not an isolation curb is being provided. When using an isolation curb, consult with the curb manufacturer before selecting spring isolation in the rooftop unit. Doubling or "stacking" spring isolation can generate a resonant vibration.

#### *Figure 10: Fan Selection Boundary*

<span id="page-11-1"></span># <span id="page-11-3"></span>**Altitude Adjustments**

Fan curve performance is based on 70°F air temperature and sea level elevation. Selections at any other conditions require the following adjustment for air densities listed in [Table 3](#page-11-2). Higher elevations generally require more rpm to provide a given static pressure but less bhp due to the decrease in air density.

- 1. Assume 10,000 cfm is required at 3.5" TSP. The elevation is 5000 ft. and 70°F average air temperature is selected. A 20" DWDI airfoil fan is selected.
- 2. The density adjustment factor for 5000 ft. and 70°F is 0.83.
- 3. TSP must be adjusted as follows; 3.5" / 0.83 = 4.22"
- 4. Locate 10,000 cfm and 4.22 on the fan curve. rpm = 2270 and bhp = 11.3. The required fan speed is 900 rpm.
- <span id="page-11-2"></span>5. The consumed fan power at design = 11.3 bhp × 0.83 = 9.4 bhp

#### *Table 3: Temperature and altitude conversion factors*


12------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-12-0"></span># **Condenser Performance**

Altitudes greater than sea level require a derate in condenser and cooling performance that can be estimated as follows:

- 0 to 6000 feet
	- Cooling capacity decrease factor (all sizes) = 0.5% per 1000 feet
	- Compressor kW increase factor = 0.6% per 1000 feet

The actual derate varies with each individual unit and design conditions. Your local Daikin representative can provide exact performance data.

# **Wheel Performance**

Wheel performance must be adjusted for altitude as shown in [Unit Selection on page 14](#page-13-1).

# **Furnace Performance**

Gas heat performance data is based on standard 70°F air temperature and zero feet altitude (sea level).

For altitudes of 2000 feet and higher, the gas burner must be derated 4% for ever 1000 feet of altitude.

### **Example:**

A 1000 MBh furnace at an altitude of 5000 feet is derated (0.04 × 3 = 0.12). At 1000 MBh input (1000 × 0.12 MBh), the actual input is (1000 – 120 = 880 MBh) at 5000 feet.

• Above 6000 feet, consult factory

<span id="page-13-1"></span>**Unit Selection**

<span id="page-13-0"></span>Achieving the optimal performance of a rooftop system requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that control the unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation and air filtration requirements, heating and cooling loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and installation limitations. Daikin RoofPak units offer a wide selection of component options providing the capability to meet diverse application requirements.

The Daikin Tools™ software selection program allows your local Daikin sales representative to provide you with fast, accurate and complete selection of Daikin RoofPak units. You also can select your unit through reference to physical, performance, dimensional, and unit weight data included in this catalog. Due to the variety of cooling coil options available, only a sample of cooling capacity data is presented in the catalog. To properly select unit equipment:

- 1. Select unit size and cooling coil
- 2. Select heating coils and equipment
- 3. Select fans and motors

Below are examples that illustrate the equations and catalog references used in the unit selection process.

### **Selection Example:**

Constant volume system with DX cooling and natural gas heat.


#### **Summer Design:**


#### **Winter Design:**


#### **Maximum Motor HP:**


### **Selecting Unit Size to Satisfy Summer Design**

Unit size is based on coil face area and cooling capacity requirements. Supply air capacity and maximum face velocity constraints should serve as a guide for selecting coil dimensions and cabinet size. Many model sizes are available with a standard and a high airflow coil selection. This flexibility prevents the need to increase cabinet size to accommodate high airflow per ton applications.

Based on the given data, the appropriate coil face area may be determined as follows:

Minimum face area = supply air volume/maximum face velocity

- = 20,000 cfm/550 fpm
- = 36.4 square feet

Referring to [Physical Data on page 18](#page-17-1), the 39.5 square foot, small face area coil of the RPS 045C to 75C units satisfies the required face velocity.

### **Wheel Cooling Capacity**

<span id="page-14-0"></span>*Figure 12: Total and Sensible Effectiveness Charts* 

**NOTE:** Based on equal intake and exhaust air flow, minimum purge, and no frost conditions. The 7812 wheel should normally be used if wheel cfm > 8000 cfm.

Refer to below. The 7806 wheel is normally used at 7000 cfm. Wheel sensible and total effectiveness = 80%. Therefore, WLAT, both dry bulb and wet bulb, can be calculated by Equation 1.

### **Equation 1:**

*WLAT - RAT + 80% × (OAT - RAT) when adjusted for SCFM* 

Adjusting for SCFM is done with air density (see table) 95°F air density = 96% x 75°F air density as shown in Equation 2 below.

### **Equation 2:**

*WLAT - RAT = 80% × 96% × (OAT - RAT)* 

Solving Equation 2 indicates WLAT = 79.6 / 65.0°F. This is acceptable (80 / 65.5 is specified).

Total energy recovery wheel cooling capacity is approximately 247 MBh based on enthalpy charts.

# **DX Cooling Coil Capacity**

DX coil entering air temperature (EAT) must first be calculated and is equal to mixed air temperature (MAT) on a draw-through cooling coil. MAT, both dry bulb and wet bulb, is found through using psychometric chart mixing calculations (Equation 3).

### **Equation 3:**

*MAT - RAT = (OA cfm / total cfm) × (WLAT - RAT)*

Solving Equation 3 indicates DX coil EAT and MAT = 76.6 / 63.0°F.

DX coil capacity is specified to be 700 MBh and the RPS 60 is the most likely selection. RPS 60 DX capacity for a small face area coil is 707 MBh per the table (compressor KW = 63.7) and is acceptable (700 MBh is specified).

Total unit cooling capacity = 247 + 707 = 956 MBh.

# **R-407C versus R-22**

The cooling tables ([Table 7 on page 20](#page-19-1) through [Table 22 on page 27\)](#page-26-0) document the R-22 cooling capacity and compressor kW. The R-407C performance correction factors vary slightly with unit size and operating conditions but can be estimated as shown in the table below. Use the Daikin Tools computer selection program to get the exact R-407C performance.

### *Table 4: R-407C versus R-22*


# **Selecting the Unit Heating System**

### *Gas Heat*

When selecting a gas furnace, the system heating load, minimum airflow and maximum temperature rise constraints are needed. Refer to [Figure 13 on page 28](#page-27-1) for furnace model size selection.

For all heat exchangers, there exist a maximum temperature rise. This limitation is determined by the heat exchanger surface area to airflow ratio. Refer to [Table 24 on page 29](#page-28-0) for verification of the temperature rise capability of the furnace selected. Also, use this table when specifying baffle position based on minimum airflow design. Refer to [Altitude](#page-11-3)  [Adjustments on page 12](#page-11-3).

**NOTE:** In VAV applications, consider range of airflow modulation when selecting furnace model and baffle position.

15------------------------------------------------



### **Wheel Heating Capacity**

Refer to ([Figure 12 on page 15](#page-14-0)) for the 7806 wheel. Wheel sensible effectiveness = 80%. Therefore, WLAT dry bulb can be calculated by using Equation 3.

### **Equation 3:**

*WLAT - OAT = 80% × (RAT - OAT) when adjusted for SCFM*

Adjusting for SCFM is done with air density (see table). 33°F air density = 91.5% x 72°F air density. Therefore, Equation 3 must be modified and Equation 4 is used instead.

#### **Equation 4:**

*WLAT - OAT = 80% × 91.5% × (RAT - OAT)*

Solving Equation 4 indicates WLAT = 61.5°F. This is acceptable (61°F is specified).

Energy recovery wheel heating capacity is calculated by Equation 5.

### **Equation 5:**

*SMBh = 1.085 × (cfm / 1000) × (WLAT - OAT) = 618 MBh*

### **Furnace Capacity**

Furnace output capacity is specified to be 380 MBh and the 400 MBh furnace is the most likely selection. Minimum airflow (12,000 cfm with baffle C) is less than design cfm for this constant volume unit. Therefore, the 400 MBh furnace is the proper selection.

Total unit heating capacity = 618 + 400 = 1018 MBh.

### **Selecting Fans and Motors**

Fan and motor selections are based on total static pressure drop and design airflow. Total static pressure includes internal air pressure drops of unit components and external air pressure drops in supply and return ducts. Refer to [Component](#page-31-1)  [Pressure Drops on page 32](#page-31-1) for internal pressure drops of unit components.

Fan curves provided in [Supply Fans on page 35](#page-34-1) and [Airfoil](#page-39-1)  [Return Fans on page 40](#page-39-1) should be used when selecting unit fans and motors. To optimize fan performance, select the fan size having design airflow and static pressure intersecting as close to the first system curve after the shaded Do Not Select region as possible. Refer to [Application Considerations on](#page-8-1)  [page 9.](#page-8-1)

When selecting motor size, select the motor just below the horsepower curve. An oversized motor (large horsepower to load ratio) can greatly increase electric consumption due to the reduction in motor performance.

### **Return/Exhaust Fan Selection**

The return/exhaust fan ISP varies depending on whether or not the optional economizer and bypass damper will be utilized.

RAF / EAF TSP = return duct ESP + internal pressure drop (ISP)

- 1. 100% OA unit (no economizer or bypass) ISP = wheel + wheel prefilter + damper + hood pressure drop (see tables)
- 2. Economizer unit with bypass The larger of two parallel path ISP values should be used. The bypass path will be larger unless design OA / EA > 70% of the total design cfm.
	- a. Wheel path: ISP = wheel + wheel prefilter + hood pressure drop and is based on exhaust DFM at design.
	- b. Bypass path: ISP = bypass damper + wheel prefilter + hood pressure drop and is based on maximum exhaust cfm during economizer operation.

Therefore, for our example:

- Fan cfm = design exhaust cfm
- RAF / EAF TSP = 1.00. ESP + 1.71. ISP
- RAF / EAF cfm = 20,000 cfm
- 14.2 bhp and a 15 hp motor are required

16------------------------------------------------



### **Supply Fan and Motor**

Supply fan TSP = supply duct ESP + ISP (see tables). The return duct static pressure drop is not added to the supply fan pressure drop. Therefore, the total static pressure for the supply fan in the example is as follows:

#### **Internal pressure drops:**


#### **External pressure drops:**


**NOTE:** When gas or electric heat is provided, do not add the cooling coil diffuser pressure drop. In VAV applications with gas heat, consult your Daikin sales representative for design pressure drop determinations.

For a constant volume system a forward curve or airfoil type fan can be selected. Reference [Application Considerations](#page-8-1)  [on page 9](#page-8-1) for discussion on acoustical consideration. Considering its favorable brake horsepower, an airfoil type fan will be selected.

Entering the standard 30 in. airfoil fan curve (see [Figure 21](#page-37-0)  [on page 38](#page-37-0)) at 20,000 cfm and 3.86 in. w.g., the required fan motor size is 20 hp operating at 1266 rpm. Fan brake horsepower is 17.7 horsepower.

### **Supply Power Wiring for Units Without Electric Heat**

Sizing supply power wire for a unit is based on the circuit with the largest amperage draw. All electrical equipment is wired to a central panel for single or optional multipower connections. Refer to [Electrical Data on page 53](#page-52-1) for FLA and RLA ratings of equipment. Determination of Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) is as follows:

### *Fans and Cooling*

*MCA = 1.25 × RLA or FLA of largest motor + 1.00 × FLA of other loads*


### Therefore,

MCA = (1.25 × 25) + 1.00 × [(4)23.7 + (6)2 + 20.3] = 160 amps

Select power supply wire based on 160 amperes.

### **Calculating Unit Length**

Referring to unit "Dimensional Data" on page 41 for a draw-through RPS 060C:

- Total unit length = energy recovery + angular filter + DX coil section + fan section + heat section + discharge plenum + condensing unit
	- = 192in. + 24 in. + 24 in. + 72in. + 48 in. + 48 in. + 83 in.

= 491 inches.

**NOTE:** When selecting unit curb length, do not include the length of the condensing unit.

<span id="page-51-1"></span>**Recommended Clearances**

# <span id="page-51-0"></span>**Service Clearance**

Allow recommended service clearances shown in [Figure 44](#page-51-2). Provide a roof walkway along two sides of the unit for service and access to most controls.

### *Figure 44: Service Clearances*

<span id="page-51-2"></span>### *Cooling Coil, Heat and Supply Fan Service Clearance*

Additional clearance, "A" is recommended adjacent to the cooling coil, heat, and supply fan sections. See [Figure 25 on](#page-40-1)  [page 41](#page-40-1) through [Figure 29 on page 45](#page-44-0) to identify these sections.

### <span id="page-51-3"></span>*Table 42: Service Clearance*


# **Overhead Clearance**

- 1. Unit(s) surrounded by screens or solid walls must have no overhead obstructions over any part of the unit.
- 2. Area above condenser must be unobstructed in all installations to allow vertical air discharge.
- 3. For overhead obstructions above the air handler section, observe the following restrictions:
	- a. No overhead obstructions above the furnace flue, or within 9 in. of the flue box.
	- b. Any overhead obstruction not within 2 in. of the top of

# **Ventilation Clearance**

### *Unit(s) Surrounded by a Screen or a Fence:*

- 1. The bottom of the screen should be a minimum of 1 ft. above the roof surface.
- 2. Minimum distance, unit to screen—same as service clearance ([Table 42\)](#page-51-3).
- 3. Minimum distance, unit to unit—120 in.

### *Unit(s) Surrounded by Solid Walls:*

- 1. Minimum distance, unit to wall—96 in., all sizes
- 2. Minimum distance, unit to unit—120 in.
- 3. Wall height restrictions:
	- a. Wall on one side only or on two adjacent side—no restrictions.
	- b. Walls on more than two adjacent sides—wall height not to exceed unit height.

Do not locate outside air intakes near exhaust vents or other sources of contaminated air.

If the unit is installed where windy conditions are common, install wind screens around the unit, maintaining the clearances specified above. This is particularly important to prevent blowing snow from entering outside air intakes and to maintain adequate head pressure control when mechanical cooling is required at low outdoor air temperatures. SpeedTrol, required for compressor operation below 45°F, maintains proper head pressure in calm wind conditions.

# <span id="page-55-0"></span>**Supply Power Wiring**

### *Table 49: Recommended Power Wiring*


- 1. Units require three-phase power supply.
- 2. Allowable voltage tolerances:
	- a. 60 Hertz
		- Nameplate 208V: Min. 187V, Max. 229V
		- Nameplate 230V: Min. 207V, Max. 253V
		- Nameplate 460V: Min. 414V, Max. 506V – Nameplate 575V: Min. 518V, Max. 633V
	- b. 50 Hertz
		- Nameplate 380V: Min. 360V, Max. 418V
- 3. Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) Calculation:
- **NOTE:** If a unit is provided with multiple power connections, each must be considered alone in selecting power wiring components.

The MCA is calculated based on the following formulas:

- 1. Units with cooling and all heating except electric heat MCA = 1.25 × largest load + sum of all other loads
- 2. On units with electric heat, the MCA is computed both in the cooling mode and the heating mode and the greater of the two values is used.
	- a. Heating Mode
		- Electric heat less than or equal to 50 kW MCA = 1.25 (heater FLA + largest motor FLA) + remaining SAF (or RAF/EAF FLA).
		- Electric heat greater than or equal to 50 kW MCA = 1.25 (largest motor FLA) + heater FLA + remaining SAF (or RAF/EAF FLA).
- **NOTE:** The compressor and condenser are not included in this calculation.
	- b. Cooling Mode
		- MCA = 1.25 × largest FLA or RLA load + sum of all the other loads
- **NOTE:** Control circuit ampacity does not need to be considered in the calculation for wire sizing ampacity. If the unit is provided with one or more fan section lights, they are powered from the separate 15 amp (minimum), 120V supply required by the NEC for the unit convenience outlet.
	- 3. Size wires in accordance with Table 310-16 or 310-19 of the [National Electrical Code](http://www.nema.org/Technical/FieldReps/Pages/National-Electrical-Code.aspx).
	- 4. Wires should be sized for a maximum of 3% voltage drop.
