2. Heating capacity is based on 68°F db, 59.0°F wb (20/15°C) EAT and 68°F (20°C) EWT.

**Note:** All published flow rates are evaluated in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 51-1999/AMCA Standard 210-1999, Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Aerodynamic Performance Rating. The tested values are then corrected to standard air which may differ from measured or actual based on barometer, dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. The Constant CFM technology is a motor programming technique that predicts motor speed changes due to fan pressure variations to help maintain consistent CFM for a given speed setting. Although this technology makes significant improvements to equipment airflow, variations in field conditions and measurements must be considered during test and balance of specified CFM requirements. As a result, flow rates may differ from those in the catalog tables and selection software.

**Note:** All published flow rates are evaluated in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 51-1999/AMCA Standard 210-1999, Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Aerodynamic Performance Rating. The tested values are then corrected to standard air which may differ from measured or actual based on barometer, dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. The Constant CFM technology is a motor programming technique that predicts motor speed changes due to fan pressure variations to help maintain consistent CFM for a given speed setting. Although this technology makes significant improvements to equipment airflow, variations in field conditions and measurements must be considered during test and balance of specified CFM requirements. As a result, flow rates may differ from those in the catalog tables and selection software.

## **Flexible Configurations**

## **Cabinet**

The Enfinity Vertical Water Source Heat Pump is factory assembled and tested for reliability. Five unique cabinet sizes make up our 3/4 through 6 ton (1.8 through 21.2 kW) vertical heat pump product line. The consistent shape makes layout simple. Water, condensate and duct connections are all in similar locations to simplify installation. The fan section is separated from the compressor section with an insulated divider panel for maximum sound attenuation. A large removable panel provides easy service access to the blower and motor.

The cabinet is constructed of unpainted, G‑60 galvanized steel. The interiors of the top and side panels are covered with 1/2" thick (13 mm), 1-1/2 lb. (681 g) density coated glass fiber as standard. An optional closed cell insulation is available for applications with more stringent IAQ requirements.

## **Cabinet Configurations**

For maximum flexibility, each vertical unit is available in either a left‑hand or right‑hand return air arrangement to provide the optimum piping location and service access. The mirror image design of the units lets you configure the system using minimum ductwork and piping. This helps reduce design, material and installation costs.

## **Filter Rack**

The filter is supported by factory-mounted brackets that allow for face removal. Units come standard with a 1" (25.4 mm) thick throwaway filter mounted in a combination filter rack and return air duct collar, thus eliminating field mounted brackets. The filter can be removed from the right or left side.

**■** As a factory-installed selectable option units will have a 2" throwaway filter in a 4-sided filter rack with duct collar. Where high indoor air quality is required units will have a 4" thick, high efficiency Merv 13 filter in a 4-sided filter rack with duct collar. The filter rack can be mounted for left hand or right hand filter removal by rotating it 180 degrees. Two thumb screws allow easy removal of the access door for quick filter changes without using a tool.

### *Figure 1: Optional 2" or 4" filter rack*

### **Blower Housing**

The blower housing protrudes through the cabinet top allowing adequate material for connection to a flexible duct.

*Figure 2: Fan housing protrudes through the cabinet top for connection of flexible duct*

8------------------------------------------------



### **Electrical**

The electrical components are located in the compressor section of the unit. Separate holes are provided on the cabinet to facilitate main power and low voltage control wiring. All wiring connections are made internal to the cabinet to reduce the risk of accidental contact. Each unit is rated to accept time-delay fuses for branch circuit overcurrent protection. Single phase units are also rated for use with HACR circuit breakers.

The control box houses the major operating electrical controls including the MicroTech III unit controller, transformer, compressor relay and fan relay. Each component can be accessed easily for service or replacement.

### **Water Connections**

The water and condensate connections are FPT fittings, securely mounted flush to the corner post to allow for connection to a flexible hose without the use of a back-up wrench. This helps reduce the time required to connect the unit and helps prevent delays due to shipping damage. All vertical units are internally trapped with clear vinyl tubing, to allow inspection of condensate drain.

#### *Figure 4: Flush FPT water fittings*

### **Drain Pan**

Daikin vertical Enfinity heat pumps come standard with a Polypropylene (PP), corrosion-resistant plastic drain pan to promote good indoor air quality. The pan is double sloped for positive draining to reduce the occurrence of standing water and microbial growth. The drain pan also includes an internal condensate trap.

#### *Figure 5: Internally trapped, double-sloped drain pan*

## **R-410A Refrigerant**

**■** R-410A refrigerant has zero ozone depletion potential, no scheduled phase-out and is classified in ASHRAE Standard 31 as A1/A1 – lower toxicity, no flame propagation.

9------------------------------------------------



### **Compressors**

Enfinity water source heat pumps are designed around the most advanced compressors in the industry. A wide variety of compressor types are used to offer the best system design for the dedicated refrigerants and tonnage. This allows Enfinity water source heat pumps to deliver rated capacity with low noise levels.

Rotary compressor with R-410A is used in vertical units size 009 to 015. R-410A, non-CFC refrigerant is used in all unit sizes 009 to 070. Unit sizes 019 to 070 use a scroll compressor.

#### *Figure 6: Compressors*

## **Reversing Valve**

A 4-way reversing valve is included with all Enfinity water source heat pumps. The valve is energized in the heating mode and will "fail-safe" to the cooling mode which is the predominant mode of operation for commercial applications.

#### *Figure 7: 4-way reversing valve*

### **Thermal Expansion Valve**

All Enfinity water source heat pump units include a thermal expansion valve for refrigerant metering. The Thermal Expansion Valve (TXV) allows the unit to operate at optimum efficiency with fluid temperatures ranging from 30ºF to 110ºF, and entering air temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 90ºF. The TXV precisely meters the exact amount of refrigerant flow through the system to meet the load and deliver rated heating and cooling capacity.

### *Figure 8: Thermal expansion valve (TXV)*

## **Fluid-to-Refrigerant Coil**

The copper or cupronickel (optional) tube-in-tube coaxial heat exchanger used in Enfinity water source heat pumps are designed for maximum heat transfer at normal and low water flow rates with minimum pressure drop. The inner tube is deeply fluted to enhance heat transfer and minimize fouling. All coaxial coils are tested to 500 psig on the water side and 600 psig on the refrigerant side.

Geothermal range (VFW) units include coil and piping insulation to protect against condensation in low-temperature geothermal applications.

#### *Figure 9: Coaxial heat exchanger*

10------------------------------------------------



### **Noise Reduction**

Enfinity Water Source Heat Pumps include multiple features and options to reduce unwanted noise generation including scroll and rotary compression, viscoelastic acoustical mass plate, vibration isolated fan mounts, optional compressor sound blankets and soft starting EC motors. While good design and installation practices are always required to prevent objectionable noise, Daikin, as a leader in engineered products can also provide many other customized solutions to meet your applications requirements.

### **CorMax® Connections**

Two CorMax valves are located inside the end access panel – one on the low side and one on the high side of the refrigeration circuit – for charging and servicing. All valves are 7/16" SAE fittings.

#### *Figure 10: CorMax valve*

### **Air-to-Refrigerant Coil**

The air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. The fins are lanced and mechanically bonded to the tubes using finned edges on the inside which expand during assembly to enhance heat transfer capabilities. The maximum working pressure of the heat exchanger is 500 psig (3447 kPa). The coil is designed for optimal performance in both heating and cooling while maintaining the benefit of a compact size. Coils can be provided with an optional E-coating.

### **Refrigeration System**

Units have a coaxial heat exchanger with a copper inner tube and a steel outer tube. The air coil is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. Safety controls include a high-pressure switch and low-temperature sensor to lock out compressor operation at extreme conditions. For additional protection, units have a 7 psi (48 kPa) low-pressure switch to protect the compressor from low refrigerant charge. The low setting prevents nuisance trips while providing additional protection.

### **Blower Section**

The blower section includes the blower housing, wheel, motor and drain pan. It is separated from the compressor section by an insulated divider panel for maximum sound attenuation. The large size of the blower wheel allows it to rotate more slowly, reducing motor work to improve efficiency and provide for quiet operation. A large panel provides service access to the blower and motor. All blower/motor assemblies have a removable orifice ring on the housing to accommodate motor and blower removal without disconnecting the unit from the ductwork.

11------------------------------------------------



### **Blower Motors**

The standard blower motor is a multi-speed, Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) type with thermal overload protection. It is permanently lubricated. The motor is factory wired to maximize performance and efficiency. Unit sizes 019 and larger have a terminal strip on the motor for simple motor speed change without going back to the control box. The motor is isolated from the fan housing using rubber isolators to minimize vibration transmission. All blower/motor assemblies have a removable orifice ring on the housing to accommodate motor and blower removal without disconnecting the unit from the ductwork.

#### *Figure 11: High efficiency blower motor options*

### **EC Constant Torque Fan Motor (Option)**

The optional constant torque EC blower motor offers increased efficiencies. This motor is similar in function to a PSC, but will deliver airflow at higher external static pressures. These motors are available for sizes 009 to 012 and include a field adjustable 4-position fan speed selector switch.

**Constant Torque EC Motor Sizes 009-012**

## **EC Constant CFM Fan Motor (Option)**

For unit sizes 015 – 070, the high efficiency EC constant airflow motor option provides constant airflow and economical performance over a wide static pressure range. This motor is an ideal option for high filtration applications that utilize the optional MERV-13 air filter. One of the many benefits of the EC motor is a soft start/stop feature for quiet operation. The 4-speed fan selector switch allows for quick fan speed adjustment to optimize unit performance. **NOTE:** These motors require a neutral wire for units with 460/3 electrical.

## **MicroTech® III Unit Controller**

The MicroTech III Unit Controller is a microprocessorbased control board conveniently located in the unit control box for easy access through a removable access panel. The standalone unit controller is a hard wired interface and provides all the necessary field connections. The board can be wired for 24-volt AC output to the wall thermostat by using terminals R & C. An LED annunciator is located on the front corner of the unit chassis to quickly check the operating status of the unit.

### **MicroTech III Unit Protections & LED Fault Status Annunication**

Assumes cycle fan operation-not continuous fan operation:

- **■ Start-up** The unit will not operate until all the inputs and safety controls are checked for normal conditions.
- **■ Cooling mode –** On a call for cooling, the compressor and fan will start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is energized, the reversing valve output will be de-energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off.
- **■ Heating Mode –** On a call for heating, the compressor and fan start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is de-energized, the reversing valve output will be energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off. The reversing valve remains energized.
- **■ Short Cycle Protection & Random Start –** After power cycle or deactivation of certain alarms, or when leaving the unoccupied mode, a new random compressor startdelay time between 300 and 360 seconds is generated. The random start timer prevents compressors in different units from starting simultaneously. Compressor minimum OFF 360 sec) and compressor minimum ON (180 sec) timers prevent compressor short cycling.
- **■ Unoccupied Mode** A simple "grounded" signal between terminals U and C (no power source required), puts the unit into the unoccupied mode for night setback operation.
- **■ Motorized Valve/Pump Restart** The IV/PR (H8) terminals on the The MicroTech III unit controller are used to energize (open) a motorized valve or start a water pump to get water circulating prior to starting the compressor on call for heating or cooling. The IV/PR (H8) terminal may be "daisy chained" between 200 units.
- **■ Brownout Protection** The MicroTech III unit controller measures the input voltage and will suspend compressor and fan operation if the voltage falls below 80% of the unit nameplate rated value. A unique LED status

is generated and an output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.

- **■ Unit Shutdown** A simple grounded signal puts the unit into the shutdown mode. Compressor and fan operations are suspended. A unique LED status is generated and an output signal is made available for connection to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.
- **■ Condensate Overflow Protection** The MicroTech III unit controller incorporates a liquid sensor at the top of the drain pan. Upon sensing water, cooling and dehumidification operations are suspended and an LED status is generated.
- **■ Remote Reset of Automatic Lockouts** The Remote Reset feature provides the means to remotely reset some lockouts generated by high-pressure and/ or low-temperature faults. When the MicroTech III unit controller is locked out due to one of these faults, and the cause of the fault condition has been cleared, energizing the O-terminal for 11 seconds or more forces the MicroTech III unit controller to clear the lockout. Cycling unit power also clears a lockout if the conditions causing the fault have been alleviated.
- **■ Intelligent Alarm Reset** The Intelligent Reset feature helps to minimize nuisance trips of automatic lockouts caused by low-temperature faults in heating mode. This feature clears faults the first two times they occur within a 24-hour period and triggers an automatic lockout on the 3rd fault. The retry count is reset to zero every 24 hours.
- **■ Equipment Protection Control** The MicroTech III unit controller receives separate input signals from the refrigerant high-pressure switch and the low suction line temperature sensor. In a high-pressure situation, compressor operation is suspended. In a low temperature situation during heating operation, the unit goes into a defrost cycle where the unit is put into cooling operation for 60 seconds until the coaxial heat exchanger is free of ice. Each switch generates its own unique LED status and output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat if either situation exists.
- *Note: Most unit fault conditions are the result of operating the equipment outside the unit specifications.*

| Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up. Jumper JP3 is factory set for water freeze protection with the jumper open. Operation at fluid temperatures below 32°F with anti-freeze protection requires JP3 to be field configured for the jumper closed. If unit is employing a fresh water system (no anti-freeze protection), it is extremely important that JP3 jumper setting remains in the open position (factory default setting) in order to shut down the unit at the appropriate water temperature to protect your heat pump from freezing. Failure to do so can result in unit damage, property damage and will void unit warranty. | Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up.

## **I/O Expansion Module**

The I/O Expansion Module is a factory installed option. It is an extension of the MicroTech III unit controller and provides extra functionality.

The I/O Expansion Module has 4 main purposes:

- **■** The I/O Expansion Module has outputs to control boilerless electric or secondary heating option on a standard Water Source Heat Pump.
- **■** The I/O Expansion Module has outputs for multi-speed fans on a standard Water Source Heat Pump.
- **■** The I/O Expansion Module has an independent LED annunciator to identify operational fault conditions on dual-circuit equipment.

*Figure 12: I/O expansion module configuration jumper terminals*

### **Features**

## **Standard Heat Pumps / Single Circuit Units**

- **■** Monitors entering water temperature for boilerless electric heat control
- **■** Outputs for medium and high speed fan controls.

18------------------------------------------------



## **Typical Cooling and Heating Refrigeration Cycles**

## **(For standard heat pump operation only)**

### *Figure 13: Cooling refrigeration cycle*

When the wall thermostat calls for COOLING, the reversing valve directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger. There, the heat is removed by the water, and the hot gas condenses to become a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil. The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the air passing over the surfaces of the coil. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

#### *Figure 14: Heating refrigeration cycle*

When the wall thermostat calls for HEATING, the reversing valve directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil. There, the heat is removed by the air passing over the surfaces of the coil and the hot gas condenses and becomes a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger. The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the water. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

## **Systems**

Water source heat pump systems are one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly systems available for heating and cooling buildings. High-efficiency, self contained units (sizes 7,000 btuh to 420,000 btuh) can be placed in virtually any location within a building. Each unit responds only to the heating or cooling load of the individual zone it serves. This permits an excellent comfort level for occupants, better control of energy use for building owners and lower seasonal operating costs. The Air-Conditioning Refrigeration Institute (ARI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) publish standards so that water source heat pumps are rated for specific applications. The ARI/ISO loop options shown in this catalog are typical water source heat pump loop choices available in today's market. These systems offer benefits ranging from low cost installation to the highest energy efficiency available in the market today.

### **Boiler / Tower Applications: ISO 13256-1**

A "Boiler/Tower" application uses a simple two-pipe water circulating system that adds heat, removes heat or transfers rejected heat to other units throughout the building. The water temperature for heating is generally maintained between 65ºF – 70ºF and is usually provided by a natural gas or electric boiler located in a mechanical room. The condensing water temperature, during cooling months, is maintained between 85ºF and 95ºF and requires the use of a cooling tower to dissipate waste heat. Cooling towers can be located on the roof, or inside or adjacent to the building. This application can be the lowest cost of the loop options available.

Note: ASHRAE 90.1 standards require that circulating pumps over 10 HP will require use of "variable frequency drive" equipment and pipe insulation to be used whenever water temperatures are below 60 degrees and above 105 degrees. See ASHRAE 90.1 Standards for details.

*Figure 15: Boiler/tower application*

### **Open Loop Well Water Applications: ISO 13256-1**

"Open Loop" well water systems use ground water to remove or add heat to the interior water loop. The key benefit of an open loop system is the constant water temperature, usually 50ºF to 60ºF, which provides efficient operation at a low first cost. Most commercial designers incorporate a heat exchanger to isolate the building loop from the well water. Using heat exchangers can reduce maintenance issues while still allowing the transfer of heat from unit to unit as with the "Boiler/ Tower System". A successful design provides an ample amount of groundwater (approximately 2 GPM per ton) and adequate provisions for discharging water back to the aquifer or surface. Open Loop applications are commonly used in coastal areas where soil characteristics allow reinjection wells to return the water back to the aquifer. Note that some states have requirements on the depths of return water reinjection wells, and such wells must be approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Also, bad water quality can increase problems with heat exchanger scaling. Suspended solids can erode the heat exchanger. Strainers can be used to contain suspended solids.

*Figure 16: Open loop well application*

20------------------------------------------------



### **Closed Loop Geothermal Applications AHRI ISO 13256-1**

"Vertical Closed Loop" applications are installed by drilling vertical bore holes into the earth and inserting a plastic polyethylene supply/return pipe into the holes. The vertical wells are connected in parallel reverse return fashion to allow the water from the building to circulate evenly throughout the borefield. The circulating fluid dissipates heat to the ground in a similar manner as a "tower" and adds heat back to the loop like a boiler. If properly designed, the loop field can maintain the loop temperatures necessary to condition the building without the use of a boiler or a tower. Loop temperatures usually range from 37ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern applications can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. The number of bore holes and their depth should be determined by using commercial software that is specifically designed for vertical geothermal applications. Typical bore depths of a vertical loop range from 150 to 400 feet and generally require about 250 feet of surface area per ton of cooling.

#### *Figure 17: Vertical loop application*

A closed loop "Horizontal" geothermal application is similar to a vertical loop application with the exception that the loops are installed in trenches approximately 5 feet below the ground surface. The piping may be installed using a "four-pipe" or "six-pipe" design and could require 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of surface area per ton of cooling. Loop temperatures for a commercial application can range from 35ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern climates can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. Horizontal loops are generally not applied in urban areas because land use and costs can be prohibitive. New advances in installation procedures have improved the assembly time of horizontal loops while keeping the first cost lower than a vertical loop.

*Figure 18: Horizontal loop application*

A "Surface Water" or "Lake" closed loop system is a geothermal loop that is directly installed in a lake or body of water that is near the building. In many cases, the body of water is constructed on the building site to meet drainage or aesthetic requirements. Surface loops use bundled polyethylene coils that are connected in the same manner as a vertical or horizontal loop using a parallel reverse return design. The size and the depth of the lake is critical. Commercial design services should be used to certify that a given body of water is sufficient to withstand the building loads. Loop temperatures usually range from 35ºF to 90ºF and prove to be the best cooling performer and lowest cost loop option of the three geothermal loops. Some applications may not be good candidates due to public access or debris problems from flooding.

*Figure 19: Surface water loop application*

21------------------------------------------------



## **Application Considerations**

### **Unit Location**

The VFC, VFW water source heat pump can be installed "free standing" in an equipment room; however, closet installations are more common for the small vertical type units. Generally, the unit is located in the corner of a closet with the non-ducted return air facing 90 degrees to the door and the major access panels facing the door as shown in the illustration at right. Alternatively, the unit can have a ducted return air with the opening facing the door and the major access panels facing 90 degrees to the door. Locate a vertical unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out.

Install a field supplied line voltage disconnect for branch circuit protection.

To reduce noise emissions, install a field-provided 1/2 inch thick, isolator pad below the entire base of the vertical unit. The pad should be equal to the overall foot-print size of the unit to provide sound dampening of the unit while in operation.

	- **•** Size 060-070 10 inches

22------------------------------------------------



## **Ductwork and Attenuation**

All ductwork should conform to industry standards of good practice as described in ASHRAE Systems Guide. The discharge duct system will normally consist of a flexible connector at the unit, a non-insulated transition piece to the full duct size, a short run of duct, an elbow without vanes, and a trunk duct teeing into a branch circuit with discharge diffusers as illustrated below. Return air ducts can be brought in through a wall grille and then to the unit. The return duct system will normally consist of a flexible connector at the unit and a trunk duct to the return air grille. With metal duct material, the return air duct should be internally lined with acoustic insulation for sound attenuation.

Return air ductwork to the unit requires the optional return air duct collar/2" (51mm) filter rack kit.

*Figure 22: Suggested discharge air ducting*

# **Piping**

The water source heat pump unit is typically connected to the supply / return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydronic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

- **C** Water Supply
- **D** Line Voltage Unit Power (Electric Entrance)
- **E** Low Voltage Control Wiring (Electric Entrance)

Daikin has available optional hose kit combinations to better facilitate system flow balancing. These flexible hoses reduce vibration between the unit and the rigid piping system.

### *Figure 23: Fire rated supply or return hoses*

## **Condensate Drain**

Units include a double-sloped drain pan with an internal condensate trap. Condensate removal piping must be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

23------------------------------------------------



## **Unit Selection**

Achieving optimal performance with water source heat pump systems requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Use a building load program to determine the heating and cooling loads of each zone prior to making equipment selections. With this information, the Daikin SelectTools™ software selection program for Water Source Heat Pumps can be used to provide fast, accurate and complete selections of all Daikin water source heat pump products. SelectTools software is available by contacting your local Daikin Representative. While we recommend that you use Daikin SelectTools software for all unit selections, manual selections can be accomplished using the same zone load information and the capacity tables available in this catalog.

### **Boiler / Tower Application Manual Selections:**

The following example illustrates a typical selection for a zone in a boiler/tower system for a commercial building. A building load program determines that this zone needs 38,255 Btuh of total cooling, 31,832 Btuh of sensible cooling and 36,988 Btuh of total heating. The water temperatures for the boiler/tower system are 90ºF for cooling and 70ºF for heating. The return air temperature is 80ºF dry bulb with 67ºF wet bulb for cooling and 70ºF for heating.

### **Zone Requirements:**


Since a Model VFC 036 produces approximately 36,000 Btuh of cooling, it is not sufficient for this zone and a model VFC 042 should be considered. Model VFC is chosen because it is specifically designed for a boiler/ tower application. Typical water flow rates for boiler/ tower applications are 2.0 to 2.5 GPM per ton and in this example no antifreeze is used.

### **Selection:**


Total Cooling Capacity @ 90 EWT = 40,816 Btuh Sensible cooling capacity @ 90 EWT = 32,704 Btuh Total Heating Capacity @ 70 EWT = 52,019 Btuh CFM = 1510 @ .5 ESP (Wet Coil) Water Flow required to meet capacity = 8 GPM Water Pressure drop = 6.9 (FT. H2O)

Final Selection ..............................................VFC 042

### **Geothermal Applications:**

The following example illustrates the same zone in a geothermal application.

The load requirements for the zone are the same as the above example – 38,255 Btuh of total cooling and 31,832 Btuh of sensible cooling and 36,988 Btuh of heating. Geothermal loop software programs are available to help determine the size of the loop field based on:

- **■** Desired entering water temperatures for the system.
- **■** Specific acreage available for the loop which produces specific min./max loop temps for the unit selection.

Entering water temperatures for geothermal systems can be as high as 90º to 100ºF and as low as 30ºF based on the geographical location of the building. Water flow rates are typically 2.5 to 3 GPM per ton and the use of antifreeze is required in most northern applications.

### **Zone Requirements:**


A Model VFW is chosen for this geothermal application. Model VFW offers insulated water piping for condensation considerations and a different freezestat setting to allow entering water temperatures lower than 40ºF (with antifreeze). Output capacities should be recalculated using the "Antifreeze Correction Factors" tables shown on page 26. The Model VFW 042 is first considered but may not meet the heating load because of the reduced entering water temperatures (35ºF) and an antifreeze solution of 21% propylene (see page 26).

### **Selection:**

Model...............................VFW 042 (Geothermal model)

Total cooling capacity @ 100 EWT = 40,434 Btuh x .980 = 39,625 Sensible cooling capacity @ 100 EWT = 32,164 Btuh x .980 = 31,520 Total heating capacity @ 35 EWT = 38,335 Btuh x .975 = 37,377 CFM = 1510 @ .6 ESP (Dry Coil) Water Flow required to meet capacity = 10.8 GPM Water Pressure drop = 12.7 x 1.5 = 14.61 (FT. H2O)

Final Selection ..............................................VFW 042

*Notes: In applications where the zone may be a corner office or have excessive glass area, the heating load could be greater than the heating output capacity of the VFW 042 model (say 41,985 Btuh). The choices are to upsize the unit to the next model available (048), or add an electric duct heater to supplement the output of the 042 unit.*

## **Air Limits**

#### *Table 6: Air limits in °F (°C)*


## **Fluid Limits**

*Table 7: Fluid limits*


*Notes: 1. Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Geothermal range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.*

*2.This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

### **Environment**

This equipment is designed for indoor installation only. Sheltered locations such as attics, garages, etc., generally will not provide sufficient protection against extremes in temperature and/or humidity, and equipment performance, reliability, and service life may be adversely affected.

## **Power Supply**

A voltage variation of +/-10% of nameplate voltage is acceptable. Three-phase system imbalance shall not exceed 2%.

## **Additional Information for Initial Start-Up Only**

### **Standard Range Units:**

Units are designed to start in an ambient of 50ºF (10ºC), with entering air at 50ºF (10ºC), with entering water at 70ºF (21ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

### **Geothermal Range Units:**

Geothermal range heat pump conditioners are designed to start in an ambient of 40ºF (5ºC), with entering air at 40ºF (5ºC), with entering water at 40ºF (5ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

## **Unit with EC Motor – without Options**

#### *Table 14: 009 - 070*


*Notes: EC motors on 460/60/3 volt units require a 265 volt power supply. Both a hot AND a neutral wire are required to obtain proper fan motor voltage. Therefore, 4-wires with a wye type wiring arrangement is required.*

## **Supply and Return Water Hoses**

Available as fire rated construction in 2 or 3 foot (610 mm or 914 mm) lengths. Fire rated hoses have a synthetic polymer core with an outer rated covering of stainless steel. Fittings are steel. Assembly is "fire rated" and tested according to UL 94 with a VO rating and ASTM 84. Each hose has MPT connections. Fire rated hoses have a swivel connection at one end. Hoses are available in 3/4" (19 mm) to match the FPT fittings on the unit.

## **Condensate Hose Kit**

Available as a long clear plastic hose with the necessary clamps and a MPT hose fitting for connection to the FPT field piping.

### *Figure 25: Condensate hose kit*

## **Combination Balancing and Shutoff (Ball) Valves**

Constructed of brass and rated at 400 psig (2758 kPa) maximum working pressure. Valves have a built-in adjustable memory stop to eliminate rebalancing. Valves have FPT connections on both ends for connection to the water hose and to the field piping.

### *Figure 26: Shut off ball valve*

## **Field Installed Controls**

Used for variable pumping applications, the valve is wired in the compressor circuit and piped in the return water line from the unit.

### *Figure 27: 2-way motorized valve*

- **■** A motorized valve relay and control valve assembly includes a relay, valve and wire harness. The valve opens when the compressor is on and closes when the compressor is off. The valve is rated for 300 psig (2070 kPa).
- **■** A multiple unit control panel allows a single thermostat to control up to three units in parallel.
- **■** An auxiliary relay controls optional devices when the fan is operating. The relay has SPDT contacts.

## **Two-Inch or Four-Inch Filter Rack**

Selectable as factory-mounted or as an optional fieldinstalled kit, replacing the standard 1" filter rack. It provides a 1" (25 mm) extended collar for connection of return air ductwork and accepts a 2" (51 mm) thick, throwaway filter in a 4-sided filter rack with duct collar. Where high indoor air quality is required units will have a 4" thick, high efficiency Merv 13 filter in a 4-sided filter rack with duct collar. The filter rack can be mounted for left hand or right hand filter removal by rotating it 180 degrees. Two thumb screws allow easy removal of the access door for quick filter changes without using a tool.
