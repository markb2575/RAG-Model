# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**SmartSource® 2-Stage Horizontal & Vertical Water Source Heat Pumps**

## **Industry Leading Efficiencies, Very Quiet Operation**

SmartSource® water source heat pumps from Daikin combine industry-leading efficiencies with lownoise operation, high indoor air quality and consistent air temperatures. So now you can do your part to conserve energy and enjoy a quiet and comfortable indoor environment.

### *Why part load efficiency matters most*

SmartSource water source heat pumps are available in both vertical and horizontal configurations and in sizes from 2 to 6 tons. Part load EERs range from 26.1 to 29.8 for geothermal applications, making these units one of the most efficient available to heat and cool a commercial space. They are ideal to assist with LEED certification and for earning energy rebates and tax deductions.

*\* Consult your utility provider for rebate opportunities.* In most environments, heating and cooling systems operate at part load most of the time (see graph below). That's where SmartSource units with 2-stage compressors really shine. Here's how:

- **• Quieter –** Units operate at lower fan speeds and compressor settings under part load. That significantly reduces noise.
- **• More comfortable –** At lower fan speeds, more heat and humidity is removed as air passes through the unit. That means the air entering the room is more comfortable.
- **• More consistent comfort –** At part load, 2-stage compressors run more often, delivering a more consistent room air temperature.
- **• More energy savings –** At lower speeds, units use less energy, so you save on utility costs.
- **• Lower operating costs –** When motors and compressors cycle on and off less, they last longer. That means fewer repairs and longer part life.

### *Very quiet*

SmartSource water source heat pumps are exceptionally quiet, with published sound ratings as low as 46 dBA. Sound reduction packages are available for even greater attenuation. These units

typically operate at low compressor and fan speeds a majority of the time. The result is even quieter operation, very low energy consumption and very uniform room air temperatures.

EC motors are standard on all units, with field-selectable CFM settings. EC motors are more efficient than traditional PSC motors, which is why most utilities offer rebates for their use. EC motors also provide nearconstant fan speeds at static pressures up to one inch. The result is improved air filtration capabilities and more uniform air distribution.

### *Durable construction*

Cabinets feature a rugged heavy gauge G-60 galvanized sheet metal for exceptional durability. Slotted handles make it easy to remove panels for maintenance and service. Cleanable, foil-faced fiberglass insulation is standard in the air-handling section to minimize sound transmission while preventing fibers in the air stream. High-IAQ options include 3/8-inch, closed-cell insulation in both the compressor and air-handling sections.

### *Wide range of options*

Available options on all units include auxiliary electric heat in both internal (vertical units only) and external configurations. MERV 8 and 13 filters are available, with standard 2 inch filter rack or an optional 4 inch filter rack that accept a two-inch or four-inch cartridges. A desuperheater option

takes advantage of waste heat from the compressor to provide domestic hot water, ideal for apartments and condos. Also available is a waterside economizer or hydronic heat to minimize mechanical space conditioning by using loop water to condition the space.

Several methods of dehumidification options are available, including hot gas reheat. For geothermal applications, a unit-mounted loop pump option reduces system complexity by eliminating the need for a central pumping system.

Typical applications for SmartSource water source heat pumps include schools, clinics, office buildings, government offices, senior living facilities and other projects, both new construction and retrofit, where high efficiency is a key specification.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>## *Four Unique Dehumidification Options:*

- **• Smart Dehumidification** Uses hot gas reheat, humidistat, 2-stage thermostat & smart air flow management for precise humidity control.
- **• Simplified Dehumidification** Uses a 3-stage thermostat to optimize unit capacity and fan speed for maximum latent capacity while decreasing room humidity levels.
- **• Humidistat Controlled Dehumidification** Uses a humidistat and 2-stage thermostat to control room humidity levels.
- **• Dehumidification Only** Uses a humidistat in cooling only mode.

# **Hot Gas Reheat Coil**

For improved indoor climate control, Daikin Applied offers accurate and cost effective dehumidification control using a hot gas reheat option known as smart dehumidification. Hot gas reheat with smart dehumidification is an excellent solution for applications where maintaining low humidity in a space is crucial. With smart dehumidification, once the space temperature is satisfied, the humidistat signal diverts the high temperature refrigerant gas to the reheat coil located downstream of the cooling coil. The conditioned and reheated air prevents over cooling of the space and maximizes moisture removal for improved indoor comfort. The smart EC fan system adjusts the air flow for optimal moisture removal, and helps keep sound levels at a minimum. It is especially effective during low load conditions when proper control is critical. Under humid conditions (60%RH) and typical loop water temperatures, the latent capacity is optimized for approximately 90% of the sensible capacity. With loop water conditions of 85°F, the leaving air temperature is approximately the same as the entering air temperature, resulting in effective dehumidification without over cooling the space.

# **Hydronic Heat**

The hydronic heat option helps to reduce energy consumption by using hot loop water temperatures to condition a space without energizing mechanical heating. Hydronic heat can help maximize heat transfer from rooms that require cooling to ones that require heating without the added cost of operating the compressor.

Variable flow pumping systems are recommended for these systems to further reduce energy consumption, while maintaining sufficient water flow during heating operation.

The unit includes a hydronic heating coil located downstream of the unit's evaporator coil and after the filter. When entering water temperatures are between 70° to 120°F, a 3-stage thermostat or room temperature sensor in conjunction with a factory-installed entering water temperature sensor and a 2-position 3-way diverting valve, determine when loop water can be diverted to the hydronic coil and the unit coax coil for hydronic heating. Smart fan controls further reduce energy consumption and sound levels by delivering optimum air flow during hydronic heat operation.

8------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Desuperheater**

The factory-installed desuperheater option saves energy by using heat that would otherwise be "wasted" to the water loop, and uses it to supplement the heating of domestic water. The desuperheater has a double-wall, vented coaxial heat exchanger, an optional water pump for 208/230- 1 and 3-phase applications, with controls to temper the make-up water.

Controls include a refrigerant discharge line thermostat, an Entering Water Temperature (EWT) thermostat and an "on-off" switch located on the outside of the unit cabinet to deactivate the desuperheater system during the heating mode.

This option is available on vertical units sizes 2 tons and larger.

# **Loop Pump(s)**

Unit-mounted loop pump(s), available on horizontal and vertical unit sizes 2 tons and larger, eliminate the need for a central pumping station. Several loop pump options are available to match the system flow and head requirements for most geothermal and water loop applications. Sized for approximately 3 GPM/ton, both low and high head options are available in a single or dual (series flow) configuration. The series configuration essentially doubles the head capabilities. A factory supplied transformer is provided for single-point power supply.

# **Waterside Economizer**

The waterside economizer option helps to reduce energy consumption by using cool loop water temperatures to condition a space without energizing mechanical cooling. Even in the coldest weather a space can experience a build-up of ambient heat from people, equipment, lighting and the sun. Buildings with temperature controlled computer rooms, media/resource rooms or medical equipment rooms, benefit from the waterside economizer when the geothermal loop field or cooling tower temperatures are cool enough to provide air conditioning.

Variable flow pumping systems are recommended for these systems to further reduce energy consumption, while maintaining sufficient water flow during economizer operation.

The waterside economizer includes a hydronic cooling coil located upstream of the unit's evaporator coil and after the filter. When entering water temperatures are between 70° to 50°F, a 3-stage thermostat or room temperature sensor in conjunction with a factory-installed entering water temperature sensor and a 2-position 3-way diverting valve, determine when loop water can be diverted to the hydronic coil and the unit coax coil for economizer cooling. Smart fan controls further reduce energy consumption and sound levels by delivering optimum air flow during economizer operation. The MicroTech III SmartSource controller determines if the economizer and mechanical cooling can be activated together, while optimizing unit airflow. The controller also provides low temperature protection to avoid economizer operation when entering water temperatures are below 35°F.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**Electric Heat (internal or external)**

Factory installed electric heaters are available on vertical units. These heaters are located above the blower housing inside the discharge air plenum. Horizontal units utilize an external duct-mounted electric heater for field-installation. Unit controls are available for boilerless, supplemental, primary or emergency electric heat to serve several different application needs. Boilerless electric heat will be energized when the entering water temperature falls below set point. This will allow electric heat to function while ensuring the compressor remains off. With supplemental electric heat control, the wall thermostat will activate the compressor and heater simultaneously if necessary to maintain room heating conditions. For primary heat applications, only the electric heater will provide heat without energizing the compressor. Emergency heat is activated by a 24V thermostat signal to energize the external duct-mounted electric heat. For available electric heat sizes and voltages see ["Model Nomenclature" on page 3,](#page-2-1) Code Item "23".

# **Designed-in Sound Reduction**

Provided as standard, the compressor mount has a unique duallevel vibration isolation system. The compressor is mounted on vibration isolation grommets to a heavy gauge mounting plate, then isolated from the cabinet base with rubber grommets to minimize vibration transfer. The compressor is equipped with thermal overload protection and is located in a well-insulated compartment away from the air stream to minimize sound transmission. All access panels have acoustic seals to eliminate panel vibration and minimize radiated sound levels. Fan noise can be minimized at low airflow with field adjustable EC fan motor settings. An optional sound reduction kit adds a 3/4" thick acoustic foam panel of insulation to the fan section and a compressor blanket (unit sizes 026 to 072 only) to help further reduce operating sound levels.

<span id="page-10-0"></span># **Cabinet**

The SmartSource vertical floor and horizontal ceiling cabinet comes with a standard rugged, textured- nonglare, powder-coat charcoal bronze paint. All cabinetry is fabricated from heavy gauge G-60 galvanized sheet metal.

The vertical floor unit offers two cabinet configurations with 4 unique cabinet sizes that make up the 2 through 6 ton vertical heat pump product line. For maximum flexibility, each vertical unit is available in either a left-hand or right-hand return air arrangement to provide the optimum piping location and service access. The mirror image design of the units allow for configuring the system using minimum ductwork and piping. This helps reduce design, material and installation costs.

Horizontal ceiling mounted units offer 4 cabinet sizes in four unique cabinet configurations with the smallest possible footprint, allowing for optimum design flexibility. Ceiling mounted units ship with heavy metal brackets, rubber isolators, fasteners and washers to suspend and isolate the unit from the building.

## **Cabinet Insulation**

Premium type insulation is provided standard with all SmartSource horizontal and vertical unit cabinets providing a high level of indoor air quality. As a standard the compressor compartment surfaces are lined with 1/2" fiberglass – multicoated type insulation. Separated from the compressor section by a partition, the blower section comes standard with 1/2" thick fiberglass cleanable foil face insulation with edges sealed or tucked to prevent introduction of fibers into the discharge air stream, providing maximum sound attenuation. The standard cabinet insulation meets NFPA 90A requirements, air erosion and mold growth limits of UL-181, fungal resistance test per ASTM-C1071 and ASTM G21, and meets zero level bacteria growth per ASTM G22. All insulation has a flame spread of less than 25 and a smoke developed classification of less than 50 per ASTM E-84 and UL 723.

Optional insulation is available in 3/8" thick closed-cell non fibrous insulation for Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).

A sound reduction package is available in 3/4" thick insulation as a factory installed option. Unit sizes 026 - 072 utilize a sound attenuating compressor blanket, combined with high technology sound material applied within the air handling compartment to further reduce sound transmitted by the unit.

# **Unit Configurations**

11------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-11-0"></span># **Field Adjustable EC Fan Motor**

EC motors are standard on all units, with 4 field-selectable CFM settings and 28 programmed CFM values. EC motors provide the ultimate in efficiency, performance flexibility and reduced sound levels. With inherent high efficiencies compared to conventional PSC or fix speed motors, the EC motor can save operating energy. The

factory installed fan speed selection switch allows for easy commissioning through a simple click of the switch to set the CFM delivered to the space. This allows for field adjustment of air delivery to the space for sound sensitive applications or for increased air distribution.

# **Two-Stage Compressors - Double Isolated**

The two-stage unloading scroll compressor provides excellent part load performance for improved humidity control and increased efficiency. The compressor has a unique dual-level vibration isolation system. Mounted on vibration

isolation grommets to a heavy gauge compressor mounting plate, then isolated from the cabinet base with rubber grommets to minimize vibration transfer. The compressor is equipped with thermal overload protection and is located in an insulated compartment away from the air stream to minimize sound transmission.

# **CorMax® Connections**

Two CorMax valves are located inside the end access panel – one on the low side and one on the high side of the refrigeration circuit – for charging and servicing. All valves are 7/16" SAE fittings.

# **Water Connections**

The water and condensate connections are FPT fittings, securely mounted flush to the corner post to allow for con-

nection to a flexible hose without the use of a back-up wrench. This helps reduce the time required to connect the unit and helps prevent delays due to shipping damage. All vertical units are internally trapped with clear vinyl tubing, to allow inspection of condensate drain.

# **2-Way Motorized Water Valve**

The optional 2-way valve is used for variable pumping applications when more than one unit is installed on a common loop.These valves are also used to conserve water when used for ground water applications.

# **Horizontal Unit Hanger Bracket**

Each horizontal unit is furnished with a mounting kit that includes heavy metal hanger brackets for hanging the

unit from field-supplied hanger rods. Rubber isolators are included for sound and vibration attenuation, as are mounting washers, bolts and lock washers. The hangers are attached to fasteners at each corner of the unit, which are an integral part of the cabinet.

# **Stainless Steel Drain Pan**

The vertical unit condensate drain pan is constructed of corrosion-resistant stainless steel. It is wrapped in closed-cell insulation, double-sloped with a "lipless", free-draining pipe connection for positive drainage and an internal trap for improved Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) that meets ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 5.11. The drain pan is provided with solid-state electronic condensate overflow protection, unlike the less reliable mechanical float switch used with many competitor drain pans. The horizontal unit condensate drain pan is sloped, allowing for the unit to be mounted level in the ceiling, without tilting the unit to encourage drainage as some competitor units require. It is constructed of the same high quality materials as the vertical unit drain pan.

<span id="page-12-0"></span># **Air-to-Refrigerant Coil**

The air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. The fins are lanced and mechanically bonded to the tubes using finned edges on the inside which expand during assembly to enhance heat transfer capabilities. The maximum working pressure of the heat exchanger is 600 psig (4137 kPa). The coil is designed for optimal performance in both

heating and cooling while maintaining the benefit of a compact size. The coils can be coated with an optional inorganic, siliconbased nano-ceramic coating. This coating has a 3,000 hour salt spray rating per ASTM B117.

# **Refrigeration System**

Units have a coaxial heat exchanger with a copper inner tube and a steel outer tube. The air coil is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. Safety controls include a 600 psi high-pressure switch and lowtemperature sensor to lock out compressor operation at

extreme conditions. For additional protection, a 7 psi (48 kPa) low-pressure switch to protect the compressor from low refrigerant charge. The low setting prevents nuisance trips while providing additional protection.

# **Blower Section**

The blower section includes the EC motor, a direct-drive centrifugal fan, fan housing, and drain pan. A duct collar protrudes through the cabinet to facilitate field-supplied duct connection. The large size of the blower wheel allows it to rotate more slowly, reducing motor work to improve efficiency and provide for quiet operation. A large panel provides service access to the blower and motor. All blower/motor assemblies have a removable orifice ring on the housing to accommodate motor and blower removal without disconnecting the unit from the ductwork.

# **Disconnect Switch (Option)**

SmartSource units are available with an optional non-fused disconnect switch, located on the unit front corner post.The disconnect switch is used to break power to the unit for ease of field service and is provided with a lockout/ tag out feature.

# **Water Pressure Differential Switch (Option)**

The internal factory installed water pressure differential switch monitors water pressure drop across the heat exchanger and will disable compressor operation if flow is not detected.

# **Filter & Filter Rack**

Units come standard with a 2" (51mm) thick factoryinstalled throwaway filter, mounted in a 4-sided combination filter rack and return air duct collar. Filters can be easily removed from either side by interchanging the removable filter door to the right or left side by rotating the filter rack assembly 180 degrees. A 2" or 4" filter rack is available as a factory-installed selectable option to accept a Merv 8 or Merv 13 filter. The high Merv filter rack option is available with gaskets between it and the cabinet and along the edge of the tool-less removable door. The gaskets maintain the leakage rate below 4 CFM per square foot of filter area at .5" ESP.

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Condensate Hose Kits**

Horizontal ceiling units require an external condensate hose. These can be ordered as the long clear plastic type with the necessary clamps and a MPT hose fittings, or fire rated type for connection to the FPT field piping.


# **Electric Duct Heaters (Horizontal Units)**

Horizontal units utilize a (field-installed) external ductmounted electric heater. With boilerless electric heat, if the EWT is above the set point of the EWT thermostat, a switch is located in the control box to activate electric heat in the event of a compressor failure. With supplemental electric heat control the compressor and heater operate simultaneously, activated by a wall thermostat. "Emergency heat" is activated by a 24V signal for external ductmounted electric heat. This function is activated from the wall thermostat via the "Emergency Heat" switch.

### *Figure 12: External electric heater (field-installed)*


## **Filters**

A 2" or 4" filter rack is available as a field-installed accessory to accept a Merv 8 or Merv 13 filter, for applications requiring optimal Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). The high Merv filter rack is provided with gaskets between it and the cabinet and along the edge of the tool-less removable door. The gaskets maintain the leakage rate below 4 CFM per square foot of filter area at .5" ESP.

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Typical Vertical Installation**

### *Unit Location*

SmartSource vertical water source heat pumps can be installed "free standing" in an equipment room; however, closet installations are more common for the small vertical type units. Generally, the unit is located in the corner of a closet with the non-ducted return air facing 90º to the door and the major access panels facing the door as shown in [Figure 15.](#page-20-1) Alternatively, the unit can have a ducted return air with the opening facing the door and the major access panels facing 90º to the door.

Locate a vertical unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out.

Install a field supplied line voltage disconnect for branch circuit protection.

To reduce noise emissions, install a field-provided 1/2 inch thick, isolator pad below the entire base of the vertical unit. The pad should be equal to the overall foot-print size of the unit to provide sound dampening of the unit while in operation.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Typical Horizontal Installation**

## *Unit Location*

It is important to leave enough space for service personnel to perform maintenance or repair. Locate the horizontal unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access and do not install the unit above any piping. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out. Each unit is suspended from the ceiling by four 3/8" threaded rods fastened to the unit by a hanger bracket and rubber isolator. The design should place the unit directly below the structural members so that it is securely anchored.

Avoid installing units directly above spaces where building occupants will reside (e.g. above office desks or classrooms) to reduce the requirement for noise attenuation. Do not place units above high traffic areas because service access may be limited during occupied hours. For example, units are typically installed above the hallway drop ceiling in schools and the supply and return air is routed directly into classrooms. Local code may require fire dampers to be used with this application.

*Figure 17: Typical horizontal ceiling installation*

# **Ductwork and Attenuation**

## *Vertical Unit*

All ductwork should conform to industry standards of good practice as described in ASHRAE Systems Guide. The discharge duct system will normally consist of a flexible (boot) connector at the unit, a short run of acoustically insulated duct (approximately 10'), an 90° elbow without vanes, and a trunk duct teeing into a branch circuit with discharge diffusers as illustrated in [Figure 19](#page-22-0)  [on page 23](#page-22-0).

Return air ducts can be brought in through a wall grille and then to the unit. The return duct system will normally consist of a flexible connector at the unit and a trunk duct to the return air grille. With metal duct material, the return air duct should be internally lined with acoustic insulation for sound attenuation.

Return air ductwork to the unit requires a 2" (51mm) return air duct collar and filter rack or an optional 4" (102 mm) return air duct collar and filter rack.

### *Horizontal Unit*

Ductwork is normally applied to ceiling-mounted heat pumps on the discharge side of the unit. A discharge collar is provided on all horizontal unit models for fastening the ductwork. Use a flexible connector between the discharge collar and the duct transformation to help reduce vibration transmission from the cabinet and to simplify disconnection of the unit from the ceiling ductwork. If return ductwork is to be used, attach a flexible connector to the filter rack collar to help reduce vibration transmission and removal of the unit. Return plenum ducting should be at least 12 inches away from the coil so that the coil is evenly loaded with return air.

As a general recommendation, duct interiors should have an acoustic / thermal lining at least 1/2 inch thick over the entire duct run. For better sound attenuation, line the last five diameters of duct before each register with a one-inch thick sound blanket. Elbows, tees and dampers can create turbulence or distortion in the airflow. Place a straight length of duct, 5 to 10 times the duct width, before the next fitting to smooth out airflow. Diffusers that are located in the bottom of a trunk duct can also produce noise. For this same reason, volume control dampers should be located several duct widths upstream from an air outlet.

22------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-22-0"></span>#### *Figure 19: Vertical unit duct example*

### *Figure 20: Horizontal unit duct example*

*Notes: 1. Do not install ducts so that the air flow is counter to fan rotation. If necessary, turn fan section. 2. Transformations and units must be adequately supported so no weight is on the flexible boot connection.*

23------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-23-0"></span># **Piping**

The water source heat pump unit is typically connected to the supply / return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydronic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory

stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

Daikin has available optional hose kit combinations to better facilitate system flow balancing. These flexible hoses reduce vibration between the unit and the rigid piping system.

Polyolester Oil, commonly know as POE oil is a synthetic oil used in many refrigeration systems. POE oil, if ever in contact with PVC/CPVC will coat the inside wall of PVC/ CPVC pipe causing environmental stress fractures.

Although there is no PVC/CPVC piping in this product, please keep this in mind when selecting piping materials for your application, as system failure and property damage could result.

<span id="page-24-0"></span># **Water System Quality**

The cleaning, flushing and chemical treatment of a water source heat pump system is fundamental to efficient operation and the life expectancy of the system.

Potential system problems produced by the use of water fall into three general categories:

- **1.** Scale formation Mineral deposits which result from the crystallization and precipitation of dissolved salts in the water. The deposits form an insulating barrier, reducing the heat transfer rate and impeding the circulation of fluids due to increased pressure drop.
- **2.** Corrosion Decomposition of the metal caused by absorption of gases from the air. Corrosion may occur in any metal component of the system.
- **3.** Organic growths Slime and algae which form under certain environmental conditions, and can reduce the heat transfer rate by forming an insulating coating or can promote corrosion by pitting.

The system water should be evaluated for degrees of impurity, with testing available from independent testing labs, health departments or state agencies.

[Table 6](#page-24-1) is a list of water characteristics, the potential impurities and their results and the recommended treatment.

### *Avoiding Potential Problems*

As shown in [Table 6,](#page-24-1) all water contains some degree of impurities which may affect the performance of a heat pump system. The use of a cupro-nickel coil can help avoid potential problems. Water flow rates should:

- **A.** Be high enough that the temperature rise through the heat exchanger does not exceed 10° F when operating in the cooling mode.
- **B.** Not exceed 4 GPM per nominal ton. Flow rates that have velocities of 10 feet per second or more may cause pipe erosion and heat exchanger failure.


### <span id="page-24-1"></span>*Table 6: Water impurities, result & recommended water system application*

*Notes: 1. The tremendous variety in water quality around the country makes the recommendation of a single best method of treatment impossible. Consult a local water treatment specialist for specific treatment recommendations.*

*2. Cupro-nickel is recommended if iron bacteria is high, suspended solids or dissolved oxygen levels are high.*

*3. If the concentration of these corrosives exceeds the maximum tabulated in the cupro-nickel column, then the potential for serious corrosion problems exists.*

<span id="page-25-0"></span># **Condensate Drain**

Vertical units are factory provided with a condensate drain trap located inside the cabinet. Condensate removal piping must be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/ waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

### *Figure 22: Condensate trap detail*

Improper trapping can lead to several problems. If the trap is too tall, negative pressure will prevent drainage, causing condensate backup. If the trap is too short the seal will be destroyed or nonexistent, producing the same effect as a non-trapped system.

Construct the trap of 7/8" clear plastic piping. The condensate piping from the drain trap must be sloped to facilitate proper drainage. The clear plastic trap should be clamped and removable for cleaning. It may be necessary to manually fill the trap at system startup, or to run the unit for sufficient time to build a condensate seal. The condensate trap and condensate piping drainage should be free of any foreign debris. Debris can prevent proper drainage and unit operation and result in condensate buildup.

# <span id="page-26-0"></span>**Unit Selection**

Achieving optimal performance with water source heat pump systems requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Use a building load program to determine the heating and cooling loads of each zone prior to making equipment selections. With this information, the Daikin SelectTools™ software selection program for Water Source Heat Pumps can be used to provide fast, accurate and complete selections of all water source heat pump products. SelectTools software is available by contacting your local Daikin Representative.

While it is recommend that you use SelectTools software for all unit selections, manual selections can be accomplished using the same zone load information and the capacity tables available in this catalog.

## **Boiler/Tower (Water Loop) Application:**

The following example illustrates a typical selection for a unit in a boiler/tower system for a commercial building.

The load in this zone requires 41,099 Btuh of total cooling, 30,327 Btuh of sensible cooling and 37,758 Btuh of total heating. The entering water temperatures for the design conditions are 90°F for cooling and 70°F for heating. The return air temperature is 80°F dry bulb with 67°F wet bulb and 70°F for heating.

### *Zone Requirement:*


Since a Model GT \*038 at full-load performance produces approximately 38,500 total cooling and 27,900 Btuh sensible cooling capacity, it is not sufficient for this zone and a model GT \*044 should be considered.

## *Selection:*

### Model.................................................. GT \*044

After making the preliminary selection (GT\*044 – Full Load), enter the performance from the table[s on page](#page-35-1)  [36](#page-35-1) and *[page 37](#page-36-0)* ) at the design conditions and read Total Cooling, Sensible Cooling, and Heating Capacity at 10.5 GPM:


*Note: The above performances are based on 1,400 CFM; therefore, the capacities need to be adjusted to reflect the unit performance at the zone required CFM.* 

Determine the air flow correction factors from the table, ["Air Flow Correction Factors – Full Load" on page 46](#page-45-1). For this example use Air Flow Setting #2 (1225 CFM):

Corrected Total Cooling = 44,000 × 0.988 = 43,472 Btuh Corrected Sensible Cooling = 31,900 × 0.954 = 30,433 Btuh

Corrected Total Heating = 51,500 × 0.991 = 51,037 Btuh

Compare the corrected Total Cooling, Corrected Sensible Cooling, and the Corrected Total Heating figures to the Zone requirements. This selection meets the requirements.

Next, determine the power correction factors using the table, ["Air Flow Correction Factors – Full Load" on page](#page-45-1)  [46](#page-45-1) using Air Flow Setting #2 (1225 CFM):

Corrected Cooling Input Power = 2.908 × 0.985 = 2.864 kW

Corrected Heating Input Power = 3.040 × 0.998 = 3.034 kW

The resulting efficiencies can be determined using the corrected capacities and input power:

EER = Cooling Capacity (Btuh) ÷ Input Power (Watts) EER = 43,472 Btuh ÷ (2.864 kW × 1000) = 15.2 COP = Heating Capacity (Watts) ÷ Input Power (Watts) COP = (51,037 Btuh ÷ 3.412) ÷ (3.034 kW × 1000) = 4.93

## **Geothermal (Ground Loop) Application:**

The following example illustrates the same zone in a geothermal application.

The space requirements for the zone are the same as the previous example – 41,099 Btuh of total cooling and 30,327 Btuh of sensible cooling and 37,758 Btuh of heating. Geothermal loop software programs are available to help determine the size of the loop field based on:

- **•** Desired entering water temperatures for the system.
- **•** Specific loop field design criteria based on acreage available, loop field spacing, vertical bore depth, piping selected, flow rates, circulated heat transfer fluid, and local formation geology for the loop which produces specific min./max loop temperatures for the unit selection.

Entering fluid temperatures for geothermal systems can be as high as 110ºF and as low as 20ºF. Design entering fluid temperatures for heating and cooling are selected by the design engineer based on building loads, ground temperatures, and soil conditions. Typical design entering fluid temperatures are 90°F for cooling (summer) and 45°F for heating (winter). As a rule of thumb, the design entering fluid temperature for cooling is 10°F below the maximum outdoor air temperature, and the design entering fluid temperature for heating is 40°F above the minimum outdoor air temperature. Water flow rates are typically 2.5 to 3.0 GPM per ton and the use of antifreeze is recommended in most northern applications.

27------------------------------------------------



### *Zone Requirement:*


A Model GT \*044 is chosen for this geothermal application. Model "GT" offers insulated water piping for condensation considerations and a different freezestat setting to allow entering fluid temperatures down to 20ºF (with antifreeze). Output capacities should be recalculated using the antifreeze correction tables that are shown on *[page](#page-52-1) 53*. The Model GT \*044 is first considered but may not meet the Zone requirements due to the reduced entering fluid temperatures (45ºF) and an antifreeze solution of 20% propylene Glycol.

### *Selection:*

Model GT \*044

From the capacity tables [on page 36](#page-35-1) and *[page 37](#page-36-0)*.


Next, determine the airflow and antifreeze correction factors.

Corrected Capacity = Capacity Table Data × Air Flow Correction × Antifreeze Correction


Since the sensible capacity is slightly less than the design sensible load, judgment must be used to determine if the next larger capacity unit is necessary. Oversized equipment should be avoided to minimize the potential for humidity and comfort issues.

Next, determine the power correction factors from the table, ["Air Flow Correction Factors – Full Load" on page](#page-45-1)  [46](#page-45-1) using Air Flow Setting #2 (1225 CFM):

Corrected Cooling Input Power = 3.246 × 0.985 = 3.197 kW

Corrected Heating Input Power = 2.725 × 0.998 = 2.720 kW

The resulting efficiencies can be determined using the corrected capacities and corrected input power: EER = Cooling Capacity (Btuh) ÷ Input Power (Watts) EER = 40,569 Btuh ÷ (3.197 kW × 1000) = 12.7 COP = Heating Capacity (Watts) ÷ Input Power (Watts) COP = (37,876 Btuh ÷ 3.412) ÷ (2.720 kW × 1000) = 4.08

*\* - indicates Vertical or Horizontal configuration.*

## **Loop Pump Application and Selection**

The SmartSource loop pump package is intended for systems designed specifically for distributed or decentralized pump applications eliminating the need for central pumping systems. These systems can be applied to geothermal or boiler/tower applications. However, geothermal applications tend to be more common since system head losses can be better managed to suite the system design requirements. To do so, attention must be given to minimize head loss in the piping system. These recommendations include:

- **■** Minimize head loss in headers and unit flex hose connections to less than 4 ft. per 100 ft of pipe
- **■** Vertical bore length should be limited to:
	- **•** 200 ft for 3/4" HDPE U-tube pipe
	- **•** 300 ft for 1" HDPE U-tube pipe
	- **•** 500 ft for 1¼" HDPE U-tube pipe

*Notes: 1. Unit head loss should not exceed 12 ft of water.*

- *2. Use ball or butterfly valves to minimize head loss.*
- *3. Do not use flow control devices such as Circuit Sentry™ flow regulating valves Control valves, if necessary, Cv should be greater than or equal to the unit flow rate.*

The benefit of a decentralized system can be realized by minimizing head loss while allowing the SmartSource loop pump(s) to cycle on when there is a call for heating or cooling. This allows the loop pump(s) to remain off during the unit off-cycle. In a typical 40-hour per week operating schedule, a significant portion of the energy consumed by a central pumping systems occurs during unoccupied periods due to reduced pump efficiencies at part load. However, lower annual energy consumption can be realized with the decentralized SmartSource loop pump(s) when head loss and operating hours are minimized.

The maximum working pressure is 145 psi or 335 ft. of water. As a result, this pump system must be limited to mid-rise building applications of no more than approximately 30 stories high. Excessive working pressure can damage the pump seals and reduce the pump operating life. An intermediate heat exchanger should be considered for high-rise building applications to limit static pressures to no more than 145 psi or 335 ft. of water.

When selecting an appropriate SmartSource loop pump, the working fluid (water plus antifreeze), total head loss and flow must be known. The following represents the typical total head loss calculation for a decentralized geothermal loop pump application:

- **■** Using nominal 2-ton vertical unit W.GTV.1.026
- **■** Fluid 15% Methanol Solution in Water
- **■** Design EWT Heating 35°F

(Maximum pressure drop occurs with high density fluid. As a result, the design heating EWT will be used to calculate the Total Head Loss)

- **■** Design Water Flow 3 gpm/ton or 6 gpm for a 2-ton unit
- **■** Length of 1" HDPE piping between the unit and the loop field manifold – 40 feet of length
- **■** Geothermal Loop (1) 1" HDPE U-tube 300 feet bore depth


For the design conditions of 6 gpm and a total head loss of 16.4 Ft., select the single pump option. The system curve and pump curve for this selection is shown in [Fig](#page-28-0)[ure 25](#page-28-0). As a result, the actual calculated flow will be 7.56 gpm with a head on the pump of 28 Ft. Applications with higher head loss may require the (one) high head pump

option or one of the two-pump options using either (two) low head pumps or (two) high head pumps option, piped in series. Pumps piped in series provide approximately double the head capability compared to single pump systems. Also see ["Loop Pump Performance" on page 47](#page-46-1).

# <span id="page-43-0"></span>**Fan Performance – Constant CFM Type EC Motor**

<span id="page-43-1"></span>*Table 10: Two stage units with constant CFM type EC motor*


*Notes: <sup>1</sup> The unit is capable of high-low fan performance through the use of a 2-stage thermostat wired to specific terminals for High-Low CFM fan performance. Standard operation with a 1-stage thermostat is indicated as High CFM fan performance.*

*<sup>2</sup>Applications up to 1.0" ESP (in. wg.) are possible. However, increased fan noise should be anticipated and appropriate noise attenuation should be considered.*

# **Fan Speed Selector Switch**

A 4-position fan speed selector switch located in the control box allows CFM settings to be field adjustable. Fan speed control optimizes unit fan speed based on thermostat/room sensor inputs. The fan speed switch allows for manually setting an optimal fan speed specific to the application requirements. Each position on the fan speed switch represents settings 1-4. See *[Table](#page-43-1) 10 [on page 44](#page-43-1)* for the complete list of fan speed selector switch settngs.
