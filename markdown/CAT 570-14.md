# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Introduction**

## **Quality**

Daikin Applied air handling equipment has been respected and regarded as high quality for nearly 60 years. Daikin Applied has taken a major step in redefining the outdoor air handler with the Skyline air handler. Demands for improved indoor air quality, low sound, and high operating efficiency require a better product for today's air handler market. The Daikin Applied Skyline air handler is designed to meet or exceed these demands.

In addition to our patented construction, Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handlers feature a durable, weathertight cabinet that promotes long life of your air handler. Units ship completely assembled or by section (if necessary) with a curb-ready base rail and heavy-duty lifting lugs on all four corners to facilitate easy rigging and installation. An optional factory-supplied roof curb, specifically designed for your unit, is available in variable heights (from 16" to 30") to further simplify installation.

## **Flexibility**

By virtue of its unique frame design, the Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handler offers tremendous flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in our unique Variable Dimensioning™ feature that allows units to be sized in two-inch increments (height and width) to meet your requirements. Numerous section and component options, and the ability to arrange components in whatever arrangement is required, allow Skyline air handlers to be customized to the requirements of each job, without expensive modifications in the field.

The Daikin Applied Skyline unit can be equipped with a unitized, single piece base. This allows for a single lift, greatly reducing the time a crane has to be on site. A time spent piecing individual section together is also minimized. This configuration can be ordered with a factory manufactured, field installed piping vestibule. This allows for wider units to be shipped on a standard flat-bed truck.

For those projects that need multiple lifts, the Daikin Applied Skyline unit can be broken into sections. This allows the lift to be completed with a smaller crane or to minimize the weight on a long boom crane. This configuration comes equipped with a factory manufactured and installed piping vestibule.

## **Cabinet Construction**

Daikin Applied air handler cabinetry consists of a box-type frame channel, easy-to-remove panels or hinged access doors, and a standard base rail or an optional integral curb-ready base with heavy-duty lifting lugs. Channel material is G60 painted galvanized steel (optional—unpainted G90 galvanized steel) with neoprene gasketing on all flanges to minimize leakage. Gasketing is also factory applied at all contact surfaces between interior and exterior metal components to minimize thermal bridging. See [Figure 1](#page-5-1).

Panels are constructed of pre-painted steel and are secured to the unit with fasteners that can be easily removed to access the unit interior. Optional doors with full grip handles are also available.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>*Figure 1: Patented Gasketed Frame Channel*

### **Standard Cabinet**

This unique cabinet design results in air tight, thermally efficient units, which translates into energy savings over the life of the unit. Skyline air handlers are capable of casing leakage rates that shall not exceed 0.50 CFM per square foot of casing surface area a design static pressure up to a maximum of +5" w.c. in positive pressure sections and -6" w.c. in negative pressure sections.

6------------------------------------------------



### **High Pressure Cabinet**

The high pressure air handler construction utilizes laser welding technology to provide stronger frame channels and new gaskets to reduce the standard leakage rate to a casing leakage rate that shall not exceed ASHRAE 111 Class 6 or be no more than 1% of the supply air volume (whichever is greater) at design static pressure up to a maximum of +8" w.c. in positive pressure sections and -8" w.c. in negative pressure sections, where casing leakage (CFM/100 ft2 of casing surface area) = CL × P0.65. The high pressure air handler construction maintains the unique flexibility, ease of installation and serviceability that Skyline has had for years while providing best-in-class air sealing.

ASHRAE 111 is the test standard to test duct leakage. The standard uses a class system to indicate relative leakage rates. These class levels are dependent on static pressure and surface area. The formula for leak class is:

$$\mathbf{C}\_{\iota} = \frac{F}{\mathbf{P}^{\text{ass}}}$$
 
$$\text{where} \quad F = \begin{array}{c} \text{Leakage in CFM} \\ \text{100 ft} \text{ } \text{Cabinet Surfance } \textit{Area} \end{array} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{Static pressure in inches } \textit{w.c.}$$

A standard base rail or a heavy-duty, curb-ready base rail with integral lifting lugs on all four corners facilitates easy rigging for installation. If it is necessary to ship a unit in multiple sections, each section is equipped with a base rail and lifting lugs. A patented splice joint helps guide sections together for a tight fit, saving additional time and money on installation. Splice joints are also fully insulated at the factory.

*Figure 2: Curb-Ready Base Rail and Lifting Lugs* 

Skyline air handlers are equipped with several features to provide durability against harsh outdoor conditions. Crossbroken roofcaps eliminate standing water on the unit and a "C" cap over seam joints provides a watertight seal. The roof cap extends over optional piping vestibules without any seams. Drip shield on all sides and over doors, as well as intake and exhaust hoods with screens, direct water away from the unit and required openings. An insulated, double-walled piping vestibule encloses all piping and control valves within the unit cabinet and can be selected in varying depths to meet your piping requirements.

#### *Figure 3: Integral Piping Vestibule*

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Access and Serviceability**

Equipment must be designed to perform efficiently and withstand the wear and tear of everyday use. It also must be designed to provide easy access to interior components for routine maintenance and service to maintain peak performance. The patented frame channels and easy-toremove panels or hinged access doors of the Skyline outdoor air handler cabinet provide complete access to the unit interior and components.

#### *Figure 4: Hinged Access Doors*

## **Seismic Design Considerations**

Strict design, testing, and certification requirements for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment are clearly defined in the International Building Code, versions 2000 and 2003, for designated structures in earthquake-prone locations. The goals of these requirements are to maintain systems to protect the public from hazard and maintain essential public services immediately after an earthquake. With the widespread adoption of the IBC throughout the U.S., it is important to understand its requirements and their impact on your specific building, and where you can turn for equipment to satisfy those requirements. Tested and certified compliant with the seismic provisions of the IBC, Daikin Applied Skyline air handlers also comply with the construction requirements of NFPA 5000.

For use by the building official and design professional, the IBC has defined Seismic Use Group designations based on building use along with specific criteria for determining the Seismic Design Category of the building and the applicability of seismic design criteria to the building's mechanical equipment. Provide this information to your local Daikin Applied Sales Representative so the proper modifications can be made to the air handler and have a compliance label affixed to the product so all IBC requirements in this regard are complied with. For additional information, Daikin Applied has several published articles explaining in detail IBC seismic requirements. Go to www.DaikinApplied.com or contact your local Daikin Applied sales representative to obtain these articles.

Daikin Applied also has construction pre-certified for California's strict Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) requirements. The HCAI pre-approval shows that Daikin Applied has already completed testing to allow engineers to specify, contractors to install, and owners to operate equipment that will still work after a seismic event.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>**Component Types**

## **Fans**

Fan types available with the Daikin Applied Skyline air handling units are housed double width, double inlet (DWDI) forward curved and airfoil fans, plenum fans, twin fans and fan array. Forward curved fans generally provide the lowest first cost option and are used for lower static pressure applications.

## **DWDI Housed Fans**

Daikin Applied housed forward curved fans will typically operate up to 6.0" of static pressure. Airfoil fans have a higher first cost, but are more efficient, quieter and can handle higher static pressures. Daikin Applied housed airfoil fans will operate up to 9.0" of static pressure.

## **Plenum Fans**

Plenum fans ([Figure 5\)](#page-13-1) save space by eliminating turns in ductwork. They also provide a high degree of flexibility when locating the outlet ductwork. Plenum fans are also very good for blow-through applications as they generate a uniform outlet velocity profile. Both belt drive and direct drive plenum fans are available.

Direct drive plenum fans offer easier maintenance as they do not have fan bearings, sheaves, or belts.

## **Dual Fans**

Direct drive plenum fans come with the optional dual arrangement. The multi-fan sets will provide more even air flow and redundancy if one fan should need servicing.


#### <span id="page-13-2"></span>*Table 1: Dual Fan Width Requirements*

\* Not on 4" widths

For redundancy, the rule of thumb is that one fan will provide approximately 65% of the total CFM provided by both fans if the remaining fan is not sped up. If more redundancy is required, then a VFD and larger motor can be used to speed up the single fan to achieve more airflow. The selection software will calculate the redundancy If a manual calculation is required to calculate the maximum available airflow from the single fan, manually plot the single fan performance onto the dual fan curve as in [Figure](#page-14-0)  [6.](#page-14-0) Extend the single fan rpm line to intersect with the system static pressure line. This balance point shows the performance of a single fan when one fails.

#### *Figure 5: Plenum Fan*

<span id="page-13-1"></span>If a VFD is used, the fan can be sped up to the limit of the HP of the motor to get more airflow. To increase redundancy, a larger motor can be selected. Remember that over sized fan motors may be less efficient. This typically occurs below 50- 60% design bhp. If you over size the motor to increase redundancy, as the motor BHP drops farther away from the actual HP, the motor will run less and less efficiently. So, if the application is meant for dual fans, it may be best to simply use the best selection for efficiency and utilize what redundancy comes with this selection. This will ensure the customer will have the most efficient operating setup while having the insurance of good redundancy.

The width of the fans will determine which cabinets will allow certain fans. [Table 1](#page-13-2) will help by showing what minimum cabinet width and unit size you will need for specific fan diameter selections.

An optional motor removal gantry system is available for the Dual Plenum Fan and Fan Array options. The gantry option provides easier serviceability of motors if access is not available on both sides of the fan section.

14------------------------------------------------



#### *Figure 6: Dual Fan Redundancy – 65% If One Fan Fails*

<span id="page-14-0"></span>## **Fan Array**

The fan array section will decrease the fan section length by using multiple smaller direct-drive fans. With the stacked array, the fans will also provide a more even airflow pattern throughout the unit and will allow the fans to be placed closer to the coil. Multiple fans also provide redundancy, allowing the system to deliver full airflow and static pressure if a fan or motor is lost. All fans in the fan array are direct-drive and offer more efficient performance with no belt losses and no required shaft bearing maintenance.

The DDPL fan array section has fan diameters from 12–33 inches, with arrangements of up to 24 fans. Daikin Applied offers three motor control options to meet the highest level of redundancy. The array can be selected with a single VFD, a VFD per row or a VFD per fan. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

The ECM fan array section has a brushless, permanent magnet motor(s) for maximum efficiency. The inverter is integral to the motor. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and optional backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

The optional Microtech 4 DDC controller offers advanced technology with adaptive algorithms making equipment configuration and Daikin Applied ECM fan array management easier. The controller is factory installed on the unit, with the option for remote mounting, and can be configured for constant air volume, variable air volume, or fan tracking applications. Fan performance can be monitored via standard, factory installed airflow measurement. System operation and diagnostic information is readily available via the on-board display, for simple, intuitive troubleshooting.

<span id="page-15-0"></span>## **Coils**

The Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handler offers broad application flexibility in coil sections and coils. Coils can be arranged in draw-through or blow-through configurations. Heating only, cooling only, or cooling and heating sections are available. All coils are installed with space between each coil to allow access for cleaning and mounting of controls.

Cooling coil sections, and cooling and heating coil sections, are available in seven different section lengths to accommodate every application requirement. Drain pans extend the full length of the section. Removable access panels or doors may be provided in the deeper sections that will not interfere with piping connections extending through the unit side panels or piping vestibules.

All cooling coils are mounted over a double sloped drain pan. The cooling coil rests on coil supports located over the drain pan. The drain pan extends beyond the leaving side of the coil to help recover condensate. The primary drain pan also extends under the coil headers and return bends to help remove condensate from the unit. A full thickness of insulation is always provided between the drain pan and the bottom outer panel. The drain pan is sloped in two planes to promote proper condensate removal.

Coil connections are grommet sealed inside and outside to ensure low cabinet leakage, and the connections always extend through the unit cabinetry, allowing for the easy connection of valves and piping [\(Figure 10](#page-15-1)). All valves and piping can be enclosed within a piping vestibule that is available in varying depths to meet piping requirements. Water coil vents and drains are located outside the cabinetry.

Coils are available in a range of face area sizes, including small, medium, large staggered. Generally, small face area coils are used for heating applications with bypass and medium and large face area coils are used for cooling applications with bypass.

With Daikin Applied being a major manufacturer of heat transfer coils, the coil options are virtually unlimited. The Daikin Applied contractor coil line has several coil types, ranging from hot and cold water, refrigerant and steam. Standard Daikin Applied coils are AHRI certified. In addition to a broad range of circuitings, fin spacing and row depths, coils can be constructed of different material types for fins, tubes, connections, and casings. This provides the ability to specify a coil to meet the application requirements.

For more information on Daikin Applied coils, consult the following catalogs:


<span id="page-15-1"></span>*Figure 10: Coil Connections, Vents, Drains, and Drain Pan Connection, Extend Through Unit Cabinetry* 

16------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-16-0"></span>## **Filters**

The Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handler is designed to house flat, angular, bag, or cartridge filters. These media types range in efficiencies up to 95% and MERV 15. ([See page 18](#page-17-1) for a description of the MERV Rating.) In addition to offering a full range of efficiencies, the filter media can be provided with an optional antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial treatments are highly recommended for a complete filtration system.

An optional filter pressure gauge may be ordered with each filter section to help promote regular servicing and prevent clogging.

Both bag and cartridge filters have a pre-filter and can be either side load or front load. An access door is provided on either side or both sides of the unit to access the filter section. Filters can be positioned any place in the unit, and as many filter sections as required can be used. Many health and food industries require stringent filtration. Often, a filter section must be the last component in the air stream.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>### **What is the MERV Rating?**

Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV)—ASHRAE Standard 52.2-1999 entitled "Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal by Particle Size" provides a methodology for determining filter efficiency at removing various sizes of particles (see [Figure 11](#page-16-1) and [Figure](#page-16-2)  [12](#page-16-2)) as the filters become loaded. There are three ranges of particle sizes that define the MERV value:

Range 1—0.3 to 1.0 .m particle size.

Range 2—1.0 to 3.0 .m particle size.

Range 3—3.0 to 10.0 .m particle size.

The [Table 2](#page-17-2) shows a comparison of the MERV rating to the average arrestance percentage by the older ASHRAE Standard 52.1 method:

<span id="page-17-2"></span>

## **Gas Heat**

Freezing coils on rooftop air handlers is always a possibility. Gas heat can be an economical way to provide heat and eliminate the possibility of freezing coils. The gas heat option is available with capacities up to 4.8 million BTU/hr and turndowns up to 40:1.

The gas heat section will be equipped with all the necessary controls and safeties. Only an analog signal (0-10Vdc) is required for control of the duct furnace.

### **Single Duct Furnaces**

Daikin Applied gas heaters are available for small morning warm up applications (single stage) with as little as 80 Mbtu/ hr. Single duct furnaces can also be used for 100% outdoor requirements with models available with turndowns as high as 10:1.

### **Dual Duct Furnaces**

Where even higher turndowns are required, many selections will be available with dual duct furnaces with turndowns as high as 20:1. This is done by putting a high turndown option on one duct furnace and staging the other duct furnace.

### **Rack configurations**

Rack configurations are used for large heating capacities and will involve up to 5 duct furnaces being stacked. This will allow for high turndown operation (up to 40:1).

#### *Figure 13: Rack Configurations*

18------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-18-0"></span>## **Access**

Access sections can be selected to meet specific application criteria. They can be placed anywhere in a unit in a variety of depths and are available in depths of 16", 24", 30", 36", 42", 48", and 54". Typically, access sections are used for fieldinstalled components, air monitoring devices, or to provide ample space between components.

## **Mixing Boxes and Economizers**

When outside and return air mixing is required, either a mixing box or an economizer section can be selected. Either component will regulate the amount of outside and return air supplied to the conditioned space. The mixing box or economizer can make use of free cooling by opening outside air dampers when the ambient air will help to condition the supply air stream. Additionally, dampers may be individually sized to provide better mixing.

Both the mixing box and economizer are provided with a Daikin Applied UltraSeal low leak damper. This damper has one of the lowest leakage rates in the industry, maximizing energy efficiency. At 4.0" static pressure and a face velocity of 1100 fpm through the dampers, the leakage rate is less than 0.2% (it is common to specify leakage rates at higher static pressures, but dampers should not exceed 2" of static pressure). The parallel airfoil blades are hollow core and fully gasketed. Continuous vinyl seals are provided between the damper blades. Stainless steel end seals and linkage built into high strength ABS plastic endcaps provide smooth, quiet operation. Mixing boxes or economizers used on Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handlers can include optional factory-installed rain hoods.

## **Face and Bypass Dampers**

Face and bypass dampers can be provided to modulate temperature by bypassing air around the coil. The opposed blades meter varying air volumes through the coil and bypass to attain the final air temperature demanded. Daikin Applied Skyline air handlers offer only low leak dampers in their face and bypass sections.

Three styles of face and bypass sections are available.

- Internal bypass is available for use with medium face area coils ([Figure 14\)](#page-18-1).
- External bypass and external right angle are used when larger face area coils are required. The damper blades are fabricated of continuous galvanized steel with the damper rods rotating in nylon bushings. Damper shaft extensions are supplied to facilitate damper motor location.
- Integral face and bypass. air handlers are pre-engineered to provide an accurate, reliable method of preheating and tempering air in standard or make-up air applications. Integral face and bypass coils maintain constant steam pressure or tube velocities through the coil to help prevent freeze-ups, while varying airflow through the coil using bypass dampers. The amount of air bypassed or heated is determined by a preset leaving air temperature. It can vary from the bypass dampers being fully closed (all air passes through the coil) for maximum heat output, to the bypass dampers being fully open (no air passes through the coil) for minimum heat output. The air is then mixed at the discharge of the coil to achieve the desired leaving air temperature. Air pressure drop is maintained constant regardless of the position of the dampers.

*Figure 14: Internal Face and Bypass Dampers* 

<span id="page-18-1"></span>

19------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-19-0"></span>## **Blenders/Air Mixers**

Stratification can occur from the mixing box when airflow from two different temperature air streams do not mix completely. This incomplete mixing can continue through the air handler and subject an unprotected coil (no glycol) to freezing temperatures, damaging the coil. With the increased minimum outdoor air requirements as identified by ASHRAE Standard 62, the likelihood for air stratification increases. An air handler must be able to handle the required amount of outdoor air, regardless of temperature, without risking damage to the coil.

Blenders/air mixers help to provide protection for coils against freeze-up due to stratification. They add additional turbulence to the passing air streams, boosting the air velocity for improved mixing. Proper distance is provided immediately downstream to give the air streams enough time to fully mix before reaching the next air handler component. Because blenders/air mixers are static devices, they require no maintenance. Different blender/air mixer lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements. The Daikin Applied SelectTools software can help select the appropriate blender/air mixer for the application.

#### *Figure 15: Blender*

## **Attenuators**

Building occupants have become increasingly conscious of the quality of their environments, and low sound levels are a key criteria. Studies have confirmed improved productivity when workers are performing in sound-controlled environments. Consequently, building owners, engineers, and architects are designing their projects with stringent sound criteria to maximize this economic benefit.

Daikin Applied Skyline outdoor air handlers are designed to provide quiet sound levels. Factory-installed attenuators are available for the discharge or return sections of the air handling unit to meet the most stringent sound attenuation requirements. Different attenuator lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements. Quality construction and an aerodynamic design give reliable performance, low pressure drop and low initial cost. The Daikin Applied SelectTools Software can help choose the correct attenuator for your application.

#### *Figure 16: Attenuator Section*

20------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Air Handler Selection**

Selecting flexible Skyline outdoor air handlers depends on many different criteria. The Quick Select tables on [page 23](#page-22-1) and [page 24](#page-23-0) provide a rough determination of air handler needs. To simplify this process, Daikin Applied designed an innovative computerized selection program—Daikin Applied SelectTools software. It allows the user to develop an air handler from the ground up and obtain all of the detail required for proper design and specification. The user can design a unit in a matter of minutes.

The program is completely integrated. All input data is carried through the selection process and considered as calculations are made. Because the program is integrated, the opportunity for errors is reduced. The software guides the user through the selection process. On-line editing helps select only viable options. The program is provided so that even the less experienced user can select air handlers accurately.

Designing an efficient air handler system depends on accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that affect unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation requirements, heating and cooling space loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and thermal media and installation limitations. Unit selection can be broken down into four steps: unit type and size, coils, accessories, and fan and motor requirements.

Generally, the unit is selected based on the air volume required and the desired face velocity through the cooling coil. For cooling coils, 400 to 525 feet per minute is considered the optimum face velocity range for dehumidification and the prevention of any moisture carryover. The Daikin Applied SelectTools software recommends the unit size based on air flow and face velocity requirements. Once the unit size is determined, select the coils and all accessory components. Once all components and coils are selected (identifying the total internal component pressure drop), select the fan.

## **Energy Recovery**

Maintaining acceptable indoor air quality is generally accomplished by introducing ventilation from outdoors. The air must be conditioned to match the indoor space requirements. Heat wheels are available as factory-installed options for

Skyline air handlers. These energy recovery components can recover 50% or more of the energy normally exhausted from a building. These devices capture heat from exhaust air as it passes through the air handler and transfer it to the supply air stream, reducing the cost of heating or cooling the outside air. Energy recovery components do this by transferring energy from a warm air stream to a colder air stream—heating cold outside air during the winter and cooling hot air during the summer.

The heat recovery wheel rotates at low speeds, capturing and transferring both sensible (heat) energy and latent (moisture) energy. The ability to transfer both sensible and latent energy gives the heat wheel several advantages. First, the required capacity of ventilation equipment is significantly reduced. Additionally, the heat wheel works at lower temperatures without frosting. The supply air from the heat wheel is not near saturation, and moisture in the ductwork is not an issue.

Further, no condensate pan or drain is required. Finally, heat wheels provide humidification so that the humidifier can be downsized. They also help to keep humidity in spaces where humidification is not applied, providing greater comfort to these zones. Heat wheels are configured on the inlets and outlets with splice collars to match the adjacent sections.

## **Selecting Coils**

The Skyline air handler provides the ability to select from multiple face area coils per unit size. Once the coil size is selected, the row and fin requirements can be determined based on performance criteria. Daikin Applied offers an extensive line of coil types and circuitings. This wide variety of circuiting, row, and fin spacing, in addition to different material types, can provide a coil selection that handles the load required.

Heating, cooling, and combination cooling and reheat sections are available. Coil sections come in many different depths to accommodate multiple rows of coils, and to provide access on the leaving air side or between coils for cleaning and inspection of the drain pan. Access in the coil section can be minimized or maximized depending on the space available and job needs. Coil sections can be placed as needed in the unit, and as many sections as required for conditioning of air can be provided.

<span id="page-21-0"></span>## **Selecting Accessories**

A complete selection of component and section types in a variety of unit arrangements and configurations is available for air mixing, filtration, and temperature control to meet specific application requirements. The outside and/or return air can be brought into the unit through a plenum, mixing box, or economizer. For mixing of the two air streams, dampers are required to modulate and direct outside and return air, which is accomplished using a mixing box or economizer. Both section types use the Daikin Applied patented UltraSeal low leak dampers. Blenders/air mixers also are available to provide proper mixing of two air streams, to prevent stratification and to help avoid damage to equipment due to freezing temperatures.

To promote good air filtration, many different filter media types and arrangements are offered. Filters can be provided in angular or flat filter racks, a variety of media efficiencies, and with or without a prefilter. The filter section can be located anywhere in the unit to filter air as it enters the unit, or in a final filter arrangement before it leaves the unit. Bag or cartridge filters can be either front or side loading.

Also available are many different size access sections for field-installed components or to provide access between components. Other options include diffusers, plenums, face and bypass dampers, sound attenuators, and blenders/air mixers. Standard access doors open outward for maximum accessibility to internal components.

## **Selecting Fans**

#### **WARNING**

#### **SMOKE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS**

Improper smoke or fume air handling can result in severe personal injury or death. A registered professional engineer must design and approve the air conditioner and air handler application to make sure smoke and fume control meet local fire codes and NFPA requirements for the specific building application.

Fan selection requires an accurate calculation of the resistance to the airflow through the entire system. This total resistance consists of the sum of two parts—the external and internal static pressure. The external static pressure is the static pressure found in the distribution system, external to the air handler. The internal unit resistance is the sum of the resistance of the coils and various other unit components and accessories. Component pressure drops are listed for specific air flows in this catalog.

Use the Daikin Applied SelectTools software to determine internal component pressure drops of the system. Once the total static pressure is known, the software identifies the fans available to properly handle the air flow and static pressure for the system. The software generates a full fan curve based on the fan selection and point of operation.

# <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

## **Installation Flexibility**

Daikin Applied central station Skyline air handlers feature sectionalized design and can ship fully assembled or in sections as required by the job site condition to provide maximum installation flexibility. Multiple fan, coil, filter, mixing box, face and bypass, and access components allow the design flexibility of built-up systems with the cost advantage of factory fabricated units.

## **Unit Location**

The structural engineer should be involved to verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Exercise extreme caution when using a wooden roof structure. Locate units away from building flue stacks or exhaust ventilators to prevent possible entry of contaminated air through the outside air intake. Allow sufficient space around the unit for service clearance.

Locating the unit away from occupied spaces and over utility areas, corridors, and auxiliary spaces helps reduce the transmission of sound and vibration to occupied spaces. A concrete deck or pad is recommended when the unit is located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential.

## **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16 in. per foot, side to side). In applications involving pitched roofs, the contractor must construct a sub-base. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side.

Applications in geographic areas that are subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

## **Ductwork**

A well-designed duct layout minimizes system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow. Avoid any abrupt change in duct size. Also avoid sharp turns in the fan discharge, particularly turns opposed to wheel rotation. If sharp bends are necessary, use turning vanes. See [Figure 17](#page-24-1) for good fan outlet practices.

<span id="page-24-1"></span>**NOTE:** Elbows should not be closer than 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the largest dimension of fan discharge opening. Place dampers at least 3 fan diameters downstream of the fan discharge.

## <span id="page-25-0"></span>**Piping and Drain Pan Traps**

Design and install piping in accordance with accepted industry standards. Do not apply undue stress at the connection to coil headers. Support pipe work independently of the coils with adequate piping flexibility for thermal expansion. Run drain lines and traps full size from the drain pan connection. Drain pans must have traps to allow the condensate from the coils to drain freely. On a draw-through unit, the trap depth and the distance between the trap outlet and drain pan outlet should be twice the negative static pressure under normal unit operation. See [Figure 18.](#page-25-1)

## **Coil Freeze Protection**

When applying the Skyline outdoor air handler in geographic areas that experience subfreezing conditions, provide coil freeze protection measures. Subfreezing temperatures can adversely affect water and steam coils during controlled or uncontrolled unit shutdowns and even during unit operation. Some temperature stratification will occur, particularly at low ambient temperatures. When required, static air mixers/ blenders are available that can significantly improve mixing and reduce stratification. This can result in improved protection against freeze-up.

Glycol is strongly recommended as a positive means of freeze protection for water coils. No control sequence can prevent coil freezing in the event of a power failure or equipment malfunction. During those periods, glycol is the only positive means of freeze protection. When selecting water coils, specify glycol to account for performance differences.

## **Vibration Isolation**

To help keep noise and vibration compatible with the intended use of the conditioned air space, apply good acoustical and vibration engineering practices during the early stages of design.

Since most applications require vibration isolation, the Skyline outdoor air handler is available with factory-installed internal isolation. Internally isolated units feature spring or rubber in shear isolators sized specifically for each fan wheel and unit size.

## **Sound**

The unit inlet, outlet, and radiated sound levels for each octave band are calculated by the Daikin Applied SelectTools software, based on your specific application. Sound performance data is derived from testing performed in accordance with AMCA Standard 300. The effects of various components, casework, and unit configurations are taken into account.

## **Filters**

Routinely replace filters to minimize filter loading. As filters get dirty, the filter pressure drop increases, causing a decrease in airflow. Depending on fan type, this airflow change can be significant. The effect of filter loading is the most critical when using 65% and 95% efficient filters.

When making a fan selection, in the system total static pressure, include a pressure drop component for filters since they get dirty. A value midway between clean and dirty filter ratings is recommended. If a minimum airflow is critical, base the selection of the fan rpm on the minimum airflow at the total static pressure associated with dirty filters. The motor horsepower then is determined by the selected rpm and the total static pressure assumed for dirty filters, which yields the largest brake horsepower. Following these recommendations should limit airflow fluctuation as the filters load.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**Air Supply Systems and Fan Laws**

An air supply system consists of an air handler cabinet, heat exchanger, filters, ductwork, grilles and registers used to distribute air throughout the building. The system is independent of the fan used to supply the system.

The resistance of the system, referred to as static pressure (SP), is dependent upon the quantity of air (cfm) that is moved through it. The air quantity is determined by the cooling, heating, and ventilating requirements.

For any system, the static pressure varies directly as the square of the air quantity. This relationship between cfm and SP establishes the system curve for that system and is expressed as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{(}\frac{\text{cfm}\_1}{\text{cfm}\_2}\text{)}^2 &= \frac{\text{SP}\_1}{\text{SP}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{SP}\_2 &= \text{SP}\_1 \left(\frac{\text{cfm}\_2}{\text{cfm}\_1}\right)^2 \end{aligned}$$

The system curve is unique for a particular system configuration. Any change to the system caused by dirty filters, damper changes, etc., results in a new system curve.

For fans operating at low pressures (less than 10" W.G.), the effects of air compression are negligible. Disregarding air compression allows fan operation in a fixed system to be expressed by simple relationships. These relationships are known as fan laws and can be used to calculate the effects of fan speed and air density changes on this system.

1. The flow rate varies directly with the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\text{cfm}\_1}{\text{cfm}\_2} = \frac{\text{rpm}\_1}{\text{rpm}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{cfm}\_2 = \text{ cfm}\_1 \left(\frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1}\right)$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases air quantity 10%.

2. The static pressure varies as the square of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\text{SP}\_1}{\text{SP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\text{rpm}\_1}{\text{rpm}\_2}\right)^2\\\text{or}\quad \text{SP}\_2 = \left(\frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1}\right)^2$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases static pressure 21%.

3. The fan brake horsepower varies as the cube of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\mathsf{HP}\_1}{\mathsf{HP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}\right)^3\\\text{or}\\\ \mathsf{HP}\_2 = \ \mathsf{HP}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3$$

- A 10% increase in fan speed increases horsepower 33%.
- 4. System static pressure and brake horsepower are directly proportional to the air density:

$$\text{SP}\_2 = \text{SP}\_1 \quad \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\text{density}\_2}{\text{density}\_1} \end{pmatrix} \quad \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1} \end{pmatrix}^3$$

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{HP}\_2 = \begin{array}{c} \text{HP}\_1 \end{array} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\text{density}\_2}{\text{density}\_1} \end{pmatrix} \quad \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1} \end{pmatrix}^3 \end{array}$$

Consequently, the static pressure and brake horsepower decrease with an increase in air temperature or higher altitude, and increase with a decrease in air temperature or lower altitude.

To determine fan performance for temperatures and altitudes other than standard (70°F, 0 ft. altitude), the static pressure must be adjusted by the density ratio before the fan rpm and bhp requirements can be determined. Density ratios are expressed as temperature and altitude conversion factors in [Table 5](#page-26-1).

<span id="page-27-0"></span>## **Fan and Motor Heat**

Motor and drive heat—The total energy input to any fan motor is consumed in two ways: by heat dissipated through the motor frame and by work output. The amount of heat dissipated by the motor is a function of its operating efficiency:

*Motor heat = input × (1 – motor efficiency)* 

A small amount of the motor work output is dissipated by the drive mechanism, which also results in a heat gain. Belt drive losses are a function of belt tension and number of belts as well as power transmitted. Typical belt drive losses range from 2% to 6% of bhp.

Whether motor and drive heat gain become part of an air handling system cooling load depends on the motor location relative to the conditioned space. For air handlers with internal motors, the motor and drive are within the conditioned space. Therefore, the motor and drive add heat to the system. Subtract this heat from the cooling capacity and add it to the heating capacity of the unit.

**Fan Heat Generation**—All of the power input to a fan results in heat gain, which must be considered as a cooling load. The amount of heat generated is directly proportional to the fan bhp:

#### *Fan heat (Btuh) = bhp × 2545*

Much of this heat generation occurs within the fan itself. Fans are not 100% efficient, and the energy losses that occur convert directly into heat. The work done by the fan on the airstream increases the temperature, pressure, and velocity of air. The heat of compression required to raise the airstream to this increased energy level is also a heat gain.

As the air travels throughout the building, its energy is deteriorated by friction, resulting in pressure drop. This is also heat gain, but it does not result in temperature rise because the air expands as the pressure is reduced. The expansion is a cooling process that offsets the heat generated by friction.

Typical fan and motor heat values are given in [Figure 19](#page-27-1).

## **Variable Air Volume**

Daikin Applied variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This true variable volume system is commonly referred to as a "squeeze-off" or "pinch-off" system. Unlike a "bypass" or "dump" system, supply air is diverted from areas where it is not required to areas that need cooling and, at system part load conditions, reduces the total fan volume. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lowers system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes.
- Lowers operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions.
- Lowers first cost by reducing space requirements for duct trunks and mechanical equipment.
- Provides system flexibility to match changing occupancy demands.

#### *Table 12: Base Rail Weights*



**Notes:**

• Weight factor for 6" high rail = 0.52 lb/in (0.00929 kg/mm) • Weight factor for 10" high rail = 0.74 lb/in (0.0132 kg/mm)

The base rail weight is determined by adding together the weight of the rail supports that run the length and width of the unit. The lengthwise support depends on the overall unit length. The cross member weight is dependent on the number of cross channels needed to support the unit. Each shipping section has a cross member located on each end. When a unit ships in one piece, the rail will have 2 end channel supports. When the unit ships in numerous shipping sections, each shipping section will have two end pieces. Fan, coil, and attenuator sections each must have additional cross member support on the entering and leaving air side of the section. If the coil section is adjacent to a fan, only one cross member is provided between them. A heating only coil section must have an additional cross member support on the entering air side. Any shipping section over 8' long requires an additional cross member.

Base rails are required on sizes 025 and above.

Example:

Determine the weight of a 6" high base rail for a size 8 unit that is 108" long, consisting of a fan, access, coil, and angular filter in a single shipping section.

Weight factor for unit length for a 6" curb is 0.52 lb/in

Weight of end cross members for each shipping section is 41 lb each pair.

*1 × 41 lb = 41 lb . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 lb*

Weight of additional cross members to support fan and coil sections. In this example the fan and coil are separated by an access section; therefore four extra cross member pieces are required for the fan and coil.

 \* These are the dimensions of the unit only. Curb-ready base adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

\*\* This value represents the height for an optional top plenum. Additional discharge openings include axial, top and single opening, opposite drive side, bottom single opening, split and removable panels. Use Daikin Applied SelectTools software for more detailed dimensional information. Height dimension does not include 2" roof cap seam.

### **Cooling Coil Section**

The single cooling coil section is available in numerous depths. This provides the option of varying the amount of space downstream from the coil for access to inspect and clean the coil and drain pan. When using a single bank of coils, the 18" deep section holds up to a 4-row water or DX coil.

Also available are staggered cooling coils. The staggered arrangement maximizes the cooling coil face area by providing two banks of coils. These two coils are not stacked, but are

*Figure 32: Dimensional Data—Cooling Coil Section* 

staggered in the direction of airflow. This configuration does require more section depth in the direction of airflow. Staggered coils are only available on unit sizes 025 and larger. The section depth required varies between 30" to 54". This depends on the unit size and number of rows in the coil.

Standard base units require a minimum cooling coil vestibule length of 12". Curb-ready base units require a minimum cooling coil vestibule length of 18".


\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. Curb-ready base adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12"

(102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height

## **Combination Cooling and Reheat Coil Section**

The combination cooling and reheat coil section is available in numerous depths. This provides the option of varying the amount of space between the cooling coil and reheat coil for access to inspect and clean the coil and drain pan. All reheat and most cooling coils are arranged in a single bank, which can be 1, 2 or 3 coils high. When using a single bank of cooling coils, the 24" deep section holds up to a 4-row water or DX coil, and a 1-row or 2-row heating coil. A 36" deep section holds a 12-row water coil and a 1 or 2-row reheat coil.

Also available are staggered cooling coils. The staggered arrangement maximizes the cooling coil face area by providing two banks of coils. These two coils are not stacked, but are staggered in the direction of airflow. This configuration does require more section depth in the direction of airflow. Staggered coils are available only on unit sizes 025 and larger. The section depth required varies between 30" to 54". This depends on the unit size and number of rows in the coil.

Standard base units require a minimum combination coil vestibule length of 12". Curb-ready base units require a minimum combination coil length of 16" and a minimum coil vestibule length of 18".

#### *Figure 33: Dimensional Data—Combination Cooling and Reheat Coil Section*

#### *Table 33: Dimensions—Combination Cooling and Reheat Coil*


 \* These are the dimensions of the unit only. Curb-ready base adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height

\*\* All cooling coil lengths listed are available for any unit size (003 to 055). Height dimension does not include 2" roof cap seam.

### **Heating Coil Section**

**NOTE:** 1.25 MPT drain connections are available as an option for heating coil sections. Standard base units require a minimum heating coil vestibule length of 12". Curb-ready base units require a heating coil minimum length of 16", and a minimum heating coil vestibule length of 18".


#### *Table 34: Dimensions—Heating Coil Section\**

\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A curb-ready base rail adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height. A base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065 and adds a minimum of 6" (152 mm) to the unitheight. Unit sizes greater than 080 require a base rail that adds a minimum of 8" (203 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

### **Blenders**

*Figure 38: Dimensional Data—Blenders* 

**NOTE:** The depth of an air mixer section varies depending on components adjacent to the mixing device. The catalog dimensions shown are for a two-blender system except sizes 040 to 090, which are three-blender systems. For applications other than this, the depth dimension varies. Use Skyline software for more detailed dimensional information.


#### *Table 41: Dimensions—Kees Blender*


 \* These are the dimensions of the unit only. Curb-ready base adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

### **Access Doors**

Access doors are an option for most sections. Fan sections are always provided with a door on one side of the unit. Access door size varies with the size of the section; they are never wider than 30". Once the door is opened outward, the opening is 2" less than the door height and width because there is a 1"

flange around the opening. Door height is always 4" shorter than section height unless the section has a drain connection. If the section has a drain pan, then the door is 6" shorter than the section height. The maximum door height is 64", except filter section doors, which are equal to section height minus 4".

#### *Figure 44: Dimensional Data—Access Doors*

#### *Table 47: Dimensions—Access Door*


\* Dimensions of the unit only. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to width and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to unit height. A 6" (152mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065. An 8" (203 mm) baserail is mandatory on all sizes 080 and larger. Height dimension does not include 2" roof cap seam.
