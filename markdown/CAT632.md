# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Features and Benefits**

## **The Compressor Technology**

Model WME's exceptional efficiency and reliability is due to its cutting-edge permanent magnet motor and magnetic bearing compressor technology. A digitally-controlled magnetic bearing

*Figure 1: Magnetic Bearing Compressor Shaft* 

system replaces conventional oil lubricated bearings and a direct drive motor eliminates the need for a lubricated gear box. The compressor shaft, shown in [Figure 1](#page-3-1), levitates on a magnetic cushion and is the compressor's only major moving component. Sensors at each magnetic bearing provide realtime feedback to the bearing control system. As a result of this sophisticated design, model WME has many advantages over chillers with traditional centrifugal compressors.

<span id="page-3-1"></span>## **Oil-Free Compressor Design Benefits**

#### *No Oil Management System = Greater Reliability*

With magnetic bearings operating in a magnetic field instead of oil-lubricated bearings, the oil handling equipment is removed. No need for:

- oil pumps
- oil reservoirs
- oil coolers
- oil filters
- water regulating valves
- oil relief valves
- oil storage and disposal
- oil system controls, starter, piping, heaters, etc.

that are needed to maintain oil quality. These devices can be a fault source in traditional chillers, and removing them significantly increases unit and system reliability.

#### *No Oil System = Reduced Maintenance Costs*

With oil removed from the system, oil samples, oil changes, oil system maintenance, oil filter changes, and leaks are eliminated.

#### *Totally Oil-Free Operation = Greater Efficiency*

The use of oil-free magnetic bearing technology significantly increases chiller efficiency by reducing frictional losses within the bearing system.

In addition, efficiency improvements can be realized since there is no oil to coat the heat transfer surfaces.

#### *No Oil Loss = Sustainable Performance*

With no possibility of oil loss at light loads or due to worn seals, the original energy saving efficiency can be maintained for the life of the chiller.

#### *No Oil System = Low Vibration & Sound Levels*

With the use of magnetic bearings, the compressor vibration levels are extremely low, minimizing vibration that could be transmitted to the structure.

With low vibration levels, sound levels are lower compared to traditional centrifugal chillers.

## <span id="page-4-1"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span>**Integrated Variable Frequency Drive**

A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) modulates compressor speed in response to load and evaporator/condenser pressure. When minimum speed is reached, moveable inlet guide vanes redirect the gas flow into the impeller. VFD's have the following benefits:

- Reduced annual energy costs when there are long periods of part load operation and/or low compressor lift (lower condenser water temperature)
- Reduced motor starting inrush current
- Reduced size of backup generators used to provide emergency power to chillers used on mission critical applications
- Increased power factor to reduce utility surcharges

## **Low Operating Costs**

Model WME offers world-class full and part load efficiency due to its advanced permanent magnet motor and magnetic bearing VFD compressor design. This allows for significant energy savings at off-design conditions compared to fixedspeed chillers. See AHRI Certification on [page 7](#page-6-1) for more information on part load performance.

## **The Control Technology**

It is only fitting that this revolutionary chiller design be matched with the advanced control technology to provide the ultimate chiller performance. Our control design includes many unique energy-saving features and interface enhancements.

## **MicroTech Controller**

The model WME chiller utilizes MicroTech digital control electronics to proactively manage unit operation and provide control of external chilled water and cooling tower pumps. The compressor runs at the minimum speed necessary to maintain cooling capacity and lift (which decreases with lower condenser water temperatures), thus minimizing energy usage over the entire range of operating conditions. By constantly monitoring chiller status and real time data, the MicroTech controller will automatically take proactive measures to relieve abnormal conditions or shut the unit down if a fault occurs.

The WME chiller includes a regenerative power system that is used to provide power to the controls and bearings during a power loss event. When power is lost, the system extracts energy from the spinning motor. The power extracted from the rotor is fed back into the controls and bearings. As the power is extracted from the rotor, the shaft naturally slows down. Once the rotor is exhausted of its kinetic energy, and the shaft has reached a near zero speed, it gently touches down onto the backup bearings. The backup bearings maintain shaft position when the compressor is in an idle state and serve as a failsafe for the primary magnetic bearing system.

Additional smart features that optimize operating efficiency have been incorporated into our MicroTech controls:

- Cooling tower control including on/off, staging, and VFD
- Direct control of water pumps
- Chilled water rest
- Demand limit control

## **HMI Touch Screen**

Operation simplicity was one of the main considerations in the development of the MicroTech control system. The operator interface is a color touch-screen monitor that is mounted on an adjustable arm. Key operating parameters and setpoints are easily accessible. For added convenience, the unit Operating and Maintenance Manual is also viewable on the touch-screen panel.

In order to track chiller performance, the MicroTech controller can record and plot water temperatures, refrigerant pressures, and motor load. These values can be downloaded through a convenient USB port in the interface and exported into a spreadsheet for further evaluation and recording purposes..

The controller memory (no batteries required) also retains the fault history for troubleshooting and monitoring unit performance. A time/date stamp is associated with each fault. The fault history can be downloaded through the USB port.

## **Open Protocol BAS Flexibility**

The exclusive open protocol feature provides seamless integration and comprehensive monitoring, control, and twoway data exchange using industry standard protocols such as LonTalk, BACnet or Modbus. Open protocol offers simple and inexpensive flexibility to use the Building Automation System of your choice without an expensive gateway panel.

Benefits include:

- Easy to integrate into your BAS of choice
- Factory- or field-installed communications module
- Integrated control logic for factory options
- Easy-to-use local user interface
- Comprehensive data exchange

## **RapidRestore and RideThrough**

Mission critical facilities such as data centers and hospitals are demanding stringent capabilities for chillers to restart and reach full load operation quickly in the event of a power loss. With both RapidRestore and RideThrough capabilities, model WME chillers are engineered to meet those needs.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**RapidRestore –** Quickly restores cooling capacity when power is restored after a power failure

- **Compressor Re-Start –** Amount of time required for the chiller to re-start
- **Fast Loading –** Amount of time required for the chiller to reach a certain load condition

**RideThrough –** The ability to maintain operation during a momentary power loss event. When RideThrough is enabled and a power loss occurs, the compressor motor maintains rotation and the VFD catches and re-synchronizes with the spinning rotor. This permits the chiller to return to its pre-power loss capacity within seconds of power being restored.

## <span id="page-6-1"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>**AHRI Certification**

Part load performance can be presented in terms of Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV), which is defined by AHRI Standard 550/590. Based on AHRI Standard 550/590, and as shown in [Figure 2,](#page-6-2) a typical chiller can operate up to 99% of the time at off-peak conditions and usually spends most of this time at less than 60% of design capacity.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>WME chillers are rated and certified to AHRI Standard 550/590. The ability of the WME chillers to achieve very high part load efficiencies, as evidenced by their world-class IPLV ratings, is due primarily to the use of a variable frequency drive and the low friction of the magnetic bearing system. For more information on variable frequency drives, see ["Integrated](#page-4-1)  [Variable Frequency Drive" on page 5](#page-4-1).

## **Compliance with ASHRAE Std. 90.1**

ASHRAE Standard 90.1 was developed to assist owners and designers to make informed choices on a building's design, systems, and equipment selection. Model WME can significantly exceed ASHRAE 90.1 minimum efficiency requirements.

## **IBC/OSHPD Seismic Certification**

Daikin Magnitude® WME chillers have been tested and certified by an independent agency, experts in seismic analysis and design to meet IBC seismic and OSHPD pre-approval. Find more information about seismic requirements and HVAC systems at [www.DaikinApplied.com.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)

## **Factory Testing**

All of centrifugal chillers (50 or 60 hertz) are factory-tested prior to shipment. Operating and safety controls are checked for correct settings and operation. This testing helps reduce field start-up issues and maintain critical construction schedules.

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

## **Location Requirements**

Daikin WME units are designed only for indoor, weatherprotected, non-freezing areas consistent with the NEMA 1 rating on the chiller, controls, and electrical panels. Equipment room temperature for operating and standby conditions is 40°F to 104°F (4.4°C to 40°C).

## **Vibration Mounting**

The Magnitude WME chiller is almost vibration-free. Consequently, floor mounted spring isolators are not usually required. Neoprene mounting pads are shipped with each unit. It is recommended to continue to use flexible piping connectors to reduce sound transmitted into the pipe and to allow for expansion and contraction.

## **System Design**

## **Water Piping**

Field installed water piping to the chiller **must** include:

- air vents at the high points.
- a cleanable water strainer upstream of the evaporator and condenser inlet connections.
- a flow proving device for both the evaporator and condenser to prevent freeze up. Flow switches, thermal dispersion switches, or Delta-P switches can be used. Note that flow switches are factory installed. Additional flow switches can be used only if they are connected in series with the ones already provided.
- sufficient shutoff valves to allow vessel isolation. The chiller must be capable of draining the water from the evaporator or condenser without draining the complete system.

It is recommended that field installed water piping to the chiller include:

- temperature sensors at the inlet and outlet connections of both vessels.
- water pressure gauge connection taps and gauges at the inlet and outlet connections of both vessels for measuring water pressure drop.

Piping must be supported to eliminate weight and strain on the fittings and connections. All evaporators and condensers have OGS-type grooved water connections (adhering to Standard AWWA C606) or optional flange connections. The installing contractor must provide matching mechanical connections. Chilled water piping must be adequately insulated.

**NOTE:** This product, in its standard configuration, is equipped with a shell and tube evaporator with carbon steel shell and copper tubes. The water or other fluid used in contact with the wetted surfaces of the heat exchangers must be clean and non-corrosive to the standard materials of construction. Daikin Applied makes no warranty as to the compatibility of fluids and materials. Non-compatible fluids may void the equipment warranty. If the compatibility of the fluid with the standard materials of construction is in question, a professional corrosion consultant should administer the proper testing and evaluate compatibility.

### **Variable Fluid Flow Rates and Tube Velocities**

Many chiller system control and energy optimization strategies require significant changes in evaporator water flow rates. The Magnitude chiller line is well suited to take full advantage of these energy saving opportunities using different combinations of shell sizes, number of tubes, and pass arrangements.

Both excessively high and excessively low fluid flow rates should be avoided. Excessively high fluid flow rates and correspondingly high tube velocities will result in high fluid pressure drops, high pumping power, and potential tube erosion or corrosion damage. Excessively low fluid flow rates and correspondingly low velocities should also be avoided as they will result in poor heat transfer, high compressor power, sedimentation and tube fouling.

## **Water Volume**

All chilled water systems need adequate time to recognize a load change to avoid short cycling of the compressors or loss of control. The potential for short cycling usually exists when the building load falls below the minimum chiller plant capacity or on close-coupled systems with very small water volumes.

Some of the things the designer should consider when looking at water volume are the minimum cooling load, the minimum chiller plant capacity during the low load period and the desired cycle time for the compressors.

Assuming that there are no sudden load changes and that the chiller plant has reasonable turndown, a rule of thumb of "gallons of water volume equal to two to three times the chilled water gpm flow rate" is often used.

A properly designed storage tank should be added if the system components do not provide sufficient water volume.

<span id="page-12-0"></span>## **Optimizing Efficiency**

A key to improving energy efficiency for any chiller is minimizing the compressor pressure lift. Reducing the lift reduces the compressor work and its energy consumption per unit of output.

The optimum plant design must take into account all of the interactions between chiller, pumps, and tower. The Daikin Energy Analyzer® 3 program (available at https:// ea.daikinapplied.com/) is an excellent tool to investigate the entire system efficiency, quickly and accurately. It is especially good at comparing different system types and operating parameters. Contact your local Daikin Applied sales office for assistance on your particular application.

## **Evaporator**

## **Reducing Evaporator Fluid Flow**

Several popular chiller plant control practices — including Variable Primary Flow systems — advocate reducing the evaporator fluid flow rate as the chiller capacity is reduced. This practice can significantly reduce the evaporator pumping power while having little effect on chiller energy consumption. The Magnitude WME chillers— with their wide range of shell, tube, and pass combinations— are ideal for application in variable evaporator flow systems as long as the minimum and maximum tube velocities are taken into consideration when selecting the chiller.

If it is decided to vary the evaporator water flow rate, the rate of change should not exceed the minimum or maximum velocity limits. Additionally, the rate of change should not exceed 50% per minute.

## **Evaporator Leaving Water Temperature**

Warmer leaving chilled water temperatures will raise the compressor's suction pressure and decrease the lift, improving efficiency. Using 45°F (7°C) leaving water instead of the typical 42°F (5.5°C) will significantly reduce chiller energy consumption.

### **Evaporator Water Temperature Difference**

The industry standard has been a 10°F (5.5°C) temperature drop in the evaporator. Increasing the drop to 12°F or 14°F (6.6°C or 7.7°C) can improve chiller efficiency and reduce pump energy consumption.

## **Condenser**

## **Reducing Condenser Fluid Flow**

Several popular chiller plant control practices also advocate reducing the condenser fluid flow rate as the chiller load is reduced. This practice can significantly reduce the condenser pumping power, but it may also have the unintended consequence of significantly increasing compressor power since the leaving condenser water temperature is directly related to compressor lift and power. The higher compressor power will typically be larger than the condenser pumping power reduction and will result in a net increase in chiller plant energy consumption. Therefore, before this strategy is applied for energy saving purposes it should be extensively modeled or used in an adaptive chiller plant control system which will take into account all of the interdependent variables affecting chiller plant energy. If it is decided to use variable condenser fluid flow, the model WME chiller can operate effectively as long as the minimum and maximum tube velocities are taken into consideration when selecting the chiller.

### **Reducing Condenser Entering Water Temperature**

As a general rule, a 1°F (0.5°C) drop in condenser entering water temperature will reduce chiller energy consumption by two percent. Cooler water lowers the condensing pressure and reduces compressor work. One or two degrees can make a noticeable difference. The incremental cost of a larger tower can be small and provide a good return on investment.

When the ambient wet bulb temperature is lower than design, the entering condenser water temperature of Magnitude® WME chillers can be lowered to improve chiller performance.

Magnitude® WME chillers can start and run with entering condenser water temperatures as low as 40°F (4.4°C). The WME chillers can also start and maintain operation with inverted conditions, meaning the entering condenser water temperature can be lower than the leaving chilled water temperature. Contact your local Daikin Applied sales office if your application requires a condenser entering water temperature lower than 40°F (4.4°C).

Depending on local climatic conditions, using the lowest possible entering condenser water temperature may be more costly in total system power consumed than the expected savings in chiller power would suggest, due to the excessive fan power required. The trade-off between better chiller efficiency and fan power should be analyzed for best overall system efficiency. The Energy Analyzer® 3 program (available at https://ea.daikinapplied.com/) can optimize the chiller/tower operation for specific buildings in specific locales.

13------------------------------------------------



### **Condenser Water Temperature Difference**

The industry standard of 3 gpm/ton or about a 9.5°F (5.3°C) delta-T works well for most applications.

## **Condenser Water Temperature Control**

Condenser water control is an important consideration in chiller plant design since condenser water temperature will directly impact chiller operation and efficiency. When the ambient wet bulb temperature is lower than peak design, the entering condenser water temperature from the cooling tower can be allowed to fall, improving chiller performance. However, operational issues may occur when the condenser water temperatures are either too high or too low. The WME chiller provides several options to assist the chiller plant designer in providing the optimum control of condenser water temperature.

#### Cooling Tower Control

Control of the cooling tower is required to maintain stability and avoid operational issues. This can be achieved through a BAS or by using the MicroTech® controller. For systems utilizing a common condenser water loop for multiple purposes, the BAS contractor must provide the control but use of the MicroTech® output signal is still recommended.

The preferred cooling tower control utilizes a variable speed fan. MicroTech® will provide a control signal to determine the proper fan speed. It can also control up to three stages of fan cycling. Note that fan cycling can cause cooling tower water temperature to fluctuate as fans stage on/off, potentially adding instability to the system.

Special consideration must be given to starting the chiller when cold condenser water is present, such as with inverted starts or changeover from free (tower) cooling to mechanical cooling. It is required that some method be used to control the condenser water to maintain proper head pressure as indicated by the MicroTech controller.

Acceptable methods are outlined below and each of these options can be controlled by the MicroTech or through a BAS utilizing the MicroTech® output signals.

1. Three-Way Bypass Valve Operation

A traditional method for building condenser pressure at startup with colder condenser water is with the use of a three-way bypass valve. The device blends warmer water leaving the condenser with cooler water from the cooling tower at the condenser inlet. The bypass valve position will change until full flow from the tower to the condenser is obtained. The MicroTech® provides only the valve position control signal. Main power to drive the valve's actuator must be provided by the installer. The three-way valve should be located close to the chiller within the equipment room to minimize the volume of water.

#### 2. Two-Way Valve Operation

Another condenser control method is to use a modulating two-way control valve located on the outlet connection of the condenser. The valve will be nearly closed at startup to restrict water flow, which keeps generated heat in the condenser until an acceptable minimum condenser pressure is reached. As heat builds, the valve will open slowly until a full flow condition from the cooling tower is established. A separate power source is required to provide power to the valve actuator.

3. VFD Operating with a Condenser Water Pump

A third method of condenser control for startup is utilizing a variable frequency drive with the condenser water pump. The speed will change as directed by the MicroTech® output signal until design flow is reached. Speed adjustments may be required during the initial chiller startup as determined by the service technician.

**NOTE:** Not using the MicroTech® logic to control valves and variable frequency drives may result in system instability, capacity reduction, and issues starting the chiller with cold condenser water temperature.

#### Condenser Pump Sequencing

It is recommended to utilize the logic built into the MicroTech controller to start the condenser pump. MicroTech has the capability to operate a primary pump and a secondary standby pump. The condenser water flow should be stopped when the chiller shuts off. This will conserve energy and prevent refrigerant from migrating to the condenser.

#### Water Side Economizer Cycle Operation

Water side economizers are commonly used for ASHRAE 90.1 compliance and energy savings. This system utilizes a heat exchanger external to the chiller when cold cooling tower water is available to provide cooling. The most common system has a heat exchanger used in conjunction with the chiller's evaporator.

The BAS contractor will need to provide controls for the heat exchanger including isolation valves and temperature control. The BAS contractor will also need to control the isolation valves for the chiller. It is important to use slow-acting type valves to prevent rapid changes in system flows. Changeover from economizer cooling to mechanical cooling requires one of the methods previously mentioned to maintain suitable condenser head pressure.

<span id="page-14-0"></span>## <span id="page-14-1"></span>**Retrofit Knockdown**

It is estimated that fifty percent of retrofit applications require partial or complete disassembly of the chiller. Magnitude® WME chillers are relatively easy to disassemble due to the small compressor size, simplified refrigerant piping, and the absence of a lubrication system with its attendant components and piping. Various knockdown arrangements are available as options.

### **Type A Knockdown -"Bolt-Together Construction"**

Chillers are built and shipped completely assembled with bolt-together construction on major components for field disassembly and re-assembly on the job site. "Bolt-Together Construction" applies to the following:

- Unit ships with vessel and/or head insulation, if ordered.
- Site disassembly and re-assembly must be supervised or completed by Daikin Applied service personnel.
- Ideal for retrofit applications.

15------------------------------------------------



### **Type B Knockdown - "Partial Disassembly"**

Compressor(s), power boxes, and control boxes are removed and shipped on separate skids; combined vessel stack is shipped together as a sub-assembly. "Partial Disassembly" applies to the following:

*Figure 7: "Partial Disassembly" - Representative Illustration* 

#### **Scope:**
