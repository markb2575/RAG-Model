## **Quality**

Daikin Applied air handling equipment has been respected and regarded as high quality for nearly 60 years. Daikin Applied has taken a major step in redefining the indoor air handler with the Vision air handler. Demands for improved indoor air quality, low sound, high operating efficiency and smaller mechanical rooms require a better product for today's air handler market. The Daikin Applied Vision air handler is designed to meet or exceed these demands.

The key to providing such a high quality product is in the basic design. The Daikin Applied Vision air handler's patented construction provides unequaled thermal efficiencies and low leak rates. In addition, Vision air handlers offer tremendous flexibility in sizing, component options, and unit arrangements to meet the indoor air quality, operating efficiency, sound and installation requirements for today's extensive commercial and custom markets.

## **Flexibility**

By virtue of its unique frame design, the Daikin Applied Vision air handler offers tremendous flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in our unique Variable Dimensioning™ feature that allows units to be sized in two-inch increments (in height) and four-inch increments (in width) to fit the available space. Numerous section and component options, and the ability to arrange components in whatever arrangement is required, allow Vision air handlers to be customized to the requirements of each job, without expensive field modifications.

Finally, Vision air handlers can be shipped as a completely assembled unit, in modules or by component sections for new or retrofit applications that require smaller sections for passage through the building.

## **Cabinet Construction**

Daikin Applied Vision air handler cabinetry consists of a boxtype frame channel—the backbone of the unit—and easy-toremove panels or hinged access doors. The unique, patented frame channel design allows three identical pieces to be bolted together to form a corner of the unit. Channel material is G90 unpainted galvanized steel (optional—painted G60 galvanized steel) with neoprene gasketing on all flanges to minimize leakage. Gasketing is also factory applied at all contact surfaces between interior and exterior metal components to minimize thermal bridging. See [Figure 1](#page-5-0).

Panels are secured to the unit with fasteners that can be easily removed to access the unit interior. The frame channel and panels are easily disassembled and reassembled, giving contractors tremendous flexibility in installing and servicing the units—even where space is limited—saving time and money. Patented splice joints [\(Figure 2\)](#page-6-1) help guide sections together for a tight fit, saving additional time and money on installation.

### *Figure 1: Patented Gasketed Frame Channel*

<span id="page-5-0"></span>## **Standard Cabinet**

This unique cabinet design results in air tight, thermally efficient units, which translates into energy savings over the life of the unit. Vision air handlers are capable of casing leakage rates that shall not exceed 0.50 CFM per square foot of casing surface area a design static pressure up to a maximum of +5" w.c. in positive pressure sections and -6" w.c. in negative pressure sections.

## **High Pressure Cabinet**

The high pressure air handler construction utilizes laser welding technology to provide stronger frame channels and new gaskets to reduce the standard leakage rate to a casing leakage rate that shall not exceed ASHRAE 111 Class 6 or be no more than 1% of the supply air volume (whichever is greater) at design static pressure up to a maximum of +8" w.c. in positive pressure sections and -8" w.c. in negative pressure sections, where casing leakage (CFM/100 ft<sup>2</sup> of casing surface area) = CL × P0.65. The high pressure air handler construction maintains the unique flexibility, ease of installation and serviceability that Vision has had for years while providing best-in-class air sealing.

ASHRAE 111 is the test standard to test duct leakage. The standard uses a class system to indicate relative leakage rates. These class levels are dependent on static pressure and surface area. The formula for leak class is:

$$C\_L = \frac{F}{P^{\
atural}}$$

$$\text{where} \quad F = \frac{Leakage\ in\ CFM}{I00\,ft^2\,\text{C}ab\,\text{net}\,\text{Surface\,Area}} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{P} = \text{Static pressure in\ inches\,\text{cm}}$$

To prove this construction works, full unit factory witness testing will be available for purchase.

Vision air handler panels use the latest technology to provide the lowest deflection, lightest weight and most importantly, the most thermally efficient 2-inch thick panel system available. R-13 insulation quality injected-foam is thermally pressed between inner and outer liners yielding an extremely rigid

<span id="page-6-0"></span>panel. The inner liner comes standard with galvanized steel or optional stainless steel. The outer liner standard is galvanized steel with options of pre-painted, or pre-painted heavy-gauge, galvanized steel.

Base rails are provided, ranging from 8" to 12" and can eliminate the need for a housekeeping pad—saving time and money on installation. A full perimeter base rail per shipping section is factory assembled.

## **Access and Serviceability**

Equipment must be designed to perform efficiently and withstand the wear and tear of everyday use. It must be designed to provide easy access to interior components for routine maintenance and service to maintain peak performance. The patented frame channels and easy-toremove panels or hinged access doors of the Vision air handler cabinet provide complete access to the unit interior and components. Components, including the fan and coil assembly, can be removed through the side of the unit, top of the unit, or a combination of both, which reduces required service clearances [\(Figure 3](#page-6-2)). Coil removal does not require access to the non-connection end of the coil. A unique coil tie down method simplifies coil removal and replacement.

# **Daikin Applied SelectTools Software Selection Program**

Because the Daikin Applied Vision air handler is so flexible and has so many different component types, there virtually are an infinite number of possible unit arrangements. To help the customer easily define their product requirements, Daikin Applied provides a user-friendly software selection program, called Daikin Applied SelectTools.

This program configures and sizes both standard and custom units. Components can be selected in minutes. This Windows® based program leads the user through the selection process by prompting for pertinent input data for all components required. Component sections are selected by placing them on a configuration screen. Once the unit layout is defined, the options and accessories are identified. The program gives immediate feedback regarding fan and coil selection, offering a choice of many different options based on the performance inputs. Once final component selections have been made, the program provides all output needed for specification and submittal purposes, including fan curves, coil performance psychometric charts, weights, dimensional drawings, and a unit specification. A fully detailed DXF file is also available.

Daikin Applied SelectTools is a comprehensive, efficient and user-friendly software selection program (see [Technical Data](#page-35-1)  [on page 36](#page-35-1) for examples of the output).

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**Component Types**

## **Fans**

Fan types available with the Daikin Applied Vision air handling units are housed double width, double inlet (DWDI) forward curved and airfoil fans, plenum fans, twin fans and fan array. Forward curved fans generally provide the lowest first cost option and are used for lower static pressure applications.

## **DWDI Housed Fans**

Daikin Applied housed forward curved fans will typically operate up to 6.0" of static pressure. Airfoil fans have a higher first cost, but are more efficient, quieter and can handle higher static pressures. Daikin Applied housed airfoil fans will operate up to 9.0" of static pressure.

## **Plenum Fans**

Plenum fans ([Figure 2\)](#page-11-1) save space by eliminating turns in ductwork. They also provide a high degree of flexibility when locating the outlet ductwork. Plenum fans are also very good for blow-through applications as they generate a uniform outlet velocity profile. Both belt drive and direct drive plenum fans are available.

Direct drive plenum fans offer easier maintenance as they do not have fan bearings, sheaves, or belts.

### <span id="page-11-3"></span>*Table 2: Direct-drive Dual Fan Width Requirements*


## **Dual Fans**

Direct drive plenum fans come with the optional dual arrangement. The multi-fan sets will provide more even air flow and redundancy if one fan should need servicing.

For redundancy, the rule of thumb is that one fan will provide approximately 65% of the total CFM provided by both fans if the remaining fan is not sped up. If more redundancy is required, then a VFD and larger motor can be used to speed up the single fan to achieve more airflow. The selection software will calculate the redundancy If a manual calculation is required to calculate the maximum available airflow from the single fan, manually plot the single fan performance onto the dual fan curve as in See [Figure](#page-12-0)  [6](#page-12-0) Extend the single fan rpm line to intersect with the system static pressure line. This balance point shows the performance of a single fan when one fails.

If a VFD is used, the fan can be sped up to the limit of the HP of the motor to get more airflow. To increase redundancy, a larger motor can be selected. Remember that over sized fan motors may be less efficient. This typically occurs below 50- 60% design bhp. If you over size the motor to increase redundancy, as the motor BHP drops farther away from the actual HP, the motor will run less and less efficiently. So, if the application is meant for dual fans, it may be best to simply use the best selection for efficiency and utilize what redundancy comes with this selection. This will ensure the customer will have the most efficient operating setup while having the insurance of good redundancy.

The width of the fans will determine which cabinets will allow certain fans. [Table 1](#page-11-2) & [Table 2](#page-11-3) will help by showing what minimum cabinet width and unit size you will need for specific fan diameter selections.

An optional motor removal gantry system is available for the Dual Plenum Fan and Fan Array options. The gantry option provides easier serviceability of motors if access is not available on both sides of the fan section.

The different types of fans are available in numerous wheel diameters per unit size. The fan size selection is always optimized and identified by the SelectTools software. The program considers performance, efficiency, sound generation and first cost and offers a number of fan sizes to select from. Fan and motor assemblies are provided with 2" spring isolators. All fans are dynamically balanced at the plant as an assembly, including the motors and drives.

12------------------------------------------------



All belt drive fans rotate on a solid steel shaft of uniform diameter that has been ground, polished, and coated with a rust inhibitor. Fan shafts are selected to have a maximum operating speed well below the first critical speed. Belt guards are available.

The fan bearings have a minimum L50 life of 200,000 hours, and are available as high as one million hours. Bearings are selected for minimum noise levels and minimal service. Bearings are self aligning and pre-lubricated for immediate use. Bearings are mounted on rigid frames and positioned to provide proper balance. All bearings include copper lubrication lines that are extended to the access side of the fan cabinet with the grease fittings located near the access door opening.

All fan motors are internally mounted. The appropriate motor size will be selected by the SelectTools software. Motors cannot be undersized, but may be oversized if desired. Motor options include open drip proof, totally enclosed fan cooled, 1 speed/1 winding, 2 speed/1 winding, and 2 speed/2 winding. All single-speed motors are standard as premium efficiency, while 2-speed motors are high efficiency.

The fan array section has fan diameters from 12–33 inches, with arrangements of up to 12 fans. Daikin Applied offers three motor control options to meet the highest level of redundancy. The array can be selected with a single VFD, a VFD per row or a VFD per fan. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

### *Figure 3: Spring Isolation*

## **Fan Array**

The fan array section will decrease the fan section length by using multiple smaller direct-drive fans. With the stacked array, the fans will also provide a more even airflow pattern throughout the unit and will allow the fans to be placed closer to the coil. Multiple fans also provide redundancy, allowing the system to deliver full airflow and static pressure if a fan or motor is lost. All fans in the fan array are direct-drive and offer more efficient performance with no belt losses and no required shaft bearing maintenance.

The fan array section has fan diameters from 12–33 inches, with arrangements of up to 24 fans. Daikin Applied offers three motor control options to meet the highest level of redundancy. The array can be selected with a single VFD, a VFD per row or a VFD per fan. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

The ECM fan array section has a brushless, permanent magnet motor(s) for maximum efficiency. The inverter is integral to the motor. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter to allow for electrical isolation of each motor.

The optional Microtech 4 DDC controller offers advanced technology with adaptive algorithms making equipment configuration and Daikin Applied Applied ECM fan array management easier. The controller is factory installed on the unit, with the option for remote mounting, and can be configured for constant air volume, variable air volume, or fan tracking applications. Fan performance can be monitored via standard, factory installed airflow measurement. System operation and diagnostic information is readily available via the on-board display, for simple, intuitive troubleshooting.

## **Coils**

The Daikin Applied Vision air handler offers broad application flexibility in coil sections and coils. Coils can be arranged in draw-through or blow-through configurations. Heating only, cooling only, or cooling and heating sections are available. All coils are installed with space between each coil to allow access for cleaning and mounting of controls.

Cooling coil sections, and cooling and heating coil sections, are available in seven different section lengths to accommodate every application requirement. Drain pans are center split with drain connections on each side. For drain connections (same end connections also available), field piping can be run under the unit, between the base rails. Removable access panels or doors may be provided in the deeper sections that will not interfere with piping connections extending through the unit side panels.

All cooling coils are mounted over a double sloped drain pan. The cooling coil rests on coil supports located over the drain pan. The drain pan extends beyond the leaving side of the coil to help recover condensate. The primary drain pan also extends under the coil headers and return bends to help remove condensate from the unit. A full thickness of insulation is always provided between the drain pan and the bottom outer panel. The drain pan is sloped in two planes to promote proper condensate removal.

Coil connections are grommet sealed inside and outside to ensure low cabinet leakage, and the connections always extend through the unit cabinetry, allowing for the easy connection of valves and piping (Figure 9). Water coil vents and drains are located outside the cabinetry.

Coils are available in two face area sizes, including medium and large.

With Daikin Applied being a major manufacturer of heat transfer coils, the coil options are virtually unlimited. The Daikin Applied contractor coil line has several coil types, ranging from hot and cold water, refrigerant and steam. Standard Daikin Applied coils are AHRI certified. In addition to a broad range of circuitings, fin spacing and row depths, coils can be constructed of different material types for fins, tubes, connections, and casings. This provides the ability to specify a coil to meet the application requirements.

For more information on Daikin Applied coils, consult the following catalogs:

## **Filters**

The Daikin Applied Vision air handler is designed to house flat, bag or cartridge filters. These media types range in efficiencies up to 95% and MERV 15. (See [page 15](#page-14-0) for a description of the MERV Rating.) In addition to offering a full range of efficiencies, the filter media can be provided with an optional antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial treatments are highly recommended for a complete filtration system.

An optional filter pressure gauge may be ordered with each filter section to help promote regular servicing and prevent clogging.

Both bag and cartridge filters have a pre-filter and can be either side load or front load. An access door is provided on either side or both sides of the unit to access the filter section. Filters can be positioned any place in the unit, and as many filter sections as required can be used. Many health and food industries require stringent filtration. Often, a filter section must be the last component in the air stream.

The Daikin Applied Vision air handler meets these requirements by providing a filter section located as the last component in the air stream, and with full sheet metal liners.

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>**What is the MERV Rating?**

Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV)—ASHRAE Standard 52.2-1999 entitled "Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal by Particle Size" provides a methodology for determining filter efficiency at removing various sizes of particles (see [Figure 8](#page-14-1)) as the filters become loaded. There are three ranges of particle sizes that define the MERV value:

Range 1—0.3 to 1.0 .m particle size.

Range 2—1.0 to 3.0 .m particle size.

Range 3—3.0 to 10.0 .m particle size.

The [Table 3](#page-14-2) shows a comparison of the MERV rating to the average arrestance percentage by the older ASHRAE Standard 52.1 method:

## **Ultraviolet Light Options**

Vision air handlers can be factory equipped with ultraviolet (UV) light options that are pre-engineered for placement to provide maximum effectiveness. Two UV light options are available. The first can be mounted on the downstream side of all cooling coils and above the unit drain pan for surface "kill" applications to comply with the GSA Facilities Standard for federal buildings. The second can be mounted in the air stream prior to filter(s) for "kill on the fly" applications. Both applications are agency approved to UL Category Code ABQK specification, HVAC Accessories, Air Duct Mounted, in addition to the ETL listing of Vision air handlers.

## **Access**

Access sections can be selected to meet specific application criteria. They can be placed anywhere in a unit in a variety of depths and are available in depths of 16" – 54". Typically, access sections are used for field-installed components, air monitoring devices, or to provide ample space between components.

## **Mixing Boxes and Economizers**

When outside and return air mixing is required, either a mixing box or an economizer section can be selected. Either component will regulate the amount of outside and return air supplied to the conditioned space. The mixing box or economizer can make use of free cooling by opening outside air dampers when the ambient air will help to condition the supply air stream. Additionally, dampers may be individually sized to provide better mixing.

Both the mixing box and economizer are provided with a Daikin Applied UltraSeal™ low leak damper. This damper has one of the lowest leakage rates in the industry, maximizing energy efficiency. At 4.0" static pressure and a face velocity of 1100 fpm through the dampers, the leakage rate is less than 0.2% (it is common to specify leakage rates at higher static pressures, but dampers should not exceed 2" of static pressure). The parallel airfoil blades are hollow core and fully gasketed. Continuous vinyl seals are provided between the damper blades. Stainless steel end seals and linkage built into high strength ABS plastic endcaps provide smooth, quiet operation.

## **Face and Bypass Dampers**

Face and bypass dampers can be provided to modulate temperature by bypassing air around the coil. The opposed blades meter varying air volumes through the coil and bypass to attain the final air temperature demanded. Daikin Applied Vision air handlers offer only low leak dampers in their face and bypass sections.

Three styles of face and bypass sections are available.

- Internal bypass is available for use with medium face area coils ([Figure 11\)](#page-16-0).
- External bypass and external right angle are used when larger face area coils are required. The damper blades are fabricated of continuous galvanized steel with the damper rods rotating in nylon bushings. Damper shaft extensions are supplied to facilitate damper motor location.
- Integral face and bypass. Vision air handlers are preengineered to provide an accurate, reliable method of preheating and tempering air in standard or make-up air applications. Integral face and bypass coils maintain constant steam pressure or tube velocities through the coil to help prevent freeze-ups, while varying airflow through the coil using bypass dampers. The amount of air bypassed or heated is determined by a preset leaving air temperature. It can vary from the bypass dampers being fully closed (all air passes through the coil) for maximum heat output, to the bypass dampers being fully open (no air passes through the coil) for minimum heat output. The air is then mixed at the discharge of the coil to achieve the desired leaving air temperature. Air pressure drop is maintained constant regardless of the position of the dampers.

16------------------------------------------------



## **Blenders/Air Mixers**

Stratification can occur from the mixing box when airflow from two different temperature air streams do not mix completely. This incomplete mixing can continue through the air handler and subject an unprotected coil (no glycol) to freezing temperatures, damaging the coil. With the increased minimum outdoor air requirements as identified by ASHRAE Standard 62, the likelihood for air stratification increases. An air handler must be able to handle the required amount of outdoor air, regardless of temperature, without risking damage to the coil.

Blenders/air mixers help to provide protection for coils against freeze-up due to stratification. They add additional turbulence to the passing air streams, boosting the air velocity for improved mixing. Proper distance is provided immediately downstream to give the air streams enough time to fully mix before reaching the next air handler component. Because blenders/air mixers are static devices, they require no maintenance. Different blender/air mixer lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements.

The Daikin Applied SelectTools software can help select the appropriate blender/air mixer for the application.

<span id="page-16-0"></span>## **Attenuators**

Building occupants have become increasingly conscious of the quality of their environments, and low sound levels are a key criteria. Studies have confirmed improved productivity when workers are performing in sound-controlled environments. Consequently, building owners, engineers, and architects are designing their projects with stringent sound criteria to maximize this economic benefit.

Daikin Applied Vision air handlers are designed to provide quiet sound levels. Factory-installed attenuators are available for the discharge or return sections of the air handling unit to meet the most stringent sound attenuation requirements. Different attenuator lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements. Quality construction and an aerodynamic design give reliable performance, low pressure drop and low initial cost. The Daikin Applied SelectTools Software can help choose the correct attenuator for your application.

### *Figure 12: Attenuator Section*

## **Digital Ready™ Air Handlers**

Vision Air Handlers can be factory-equipped with industry standard direct digital control (DDC) components for easy, low cost integration with controls by others. Sensors and actuators are selected for maximum compatibility with most DDC control systems, and are neatly wired within their shipping section to a conveniently located junction box. Digital Ready Vision air handlers save the time and costly labor needed to identify, purchase and field install DDC components to match your control system. You also benefit from uniform, proper positioning of DDC components at our factory, which promotes reliable start-up and operation.

## **Starters and VFDs**

A variety of factory-installed motor control options are available to provide operation and maintenance protection, motor efficiency, and flexibility for the Vision air handler.

These options include: Disconnect Switch, Starters, Combination Starter/Disconnect, Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) with Disconnect Switch, and VFD with Disconnect Switch and Bypass. Line reactors are available on both VFD with Disconnect Switch and VFD with Disconnect Switch and Bypass.

A unit mounted disconnect switch provides the means for disconnecting power in sight from the motor when required by the National Electric Code (NEC). The switch is a heavyduty type with a non-fused disconnect switch in a NEMA 1 enclosure. A fused disconnect is also available.

Factory mounted starters offer remote start/stop operation and overload protection for an individual fan motor with minimum field cost to wire line and control circuit power to the unit. Two starter types are available, IEC or NEMA. IEC type starters are smaller in size and are a better value. Additional options include auxiliary contacts, control transformer, selector switch, push buttons, and pilot lights. A combination starter is a starter packaged with a safety switch. These motor controllers provide remote start/stop operation as well as disconnecting means in sight of the controller.

A VFD provides adjustable speed control of a single fan motor. Typically mounted outside the fan cabinet, the VFD provides not only a lower cost than field installation, but also an optimal installation location. VFDs are preprogrammed and include a keypad for local or remote control.

A unit installed VFD with disconnect provides local or remote speed control for a single fan motor with disconnecting means within sight when required by the NEC. A non-fused disconnect is offered packaged with the VFD in a separate NEMA 1 enclosure. Installation is limited to the connection of power and control wires at the device.

Packaged VFD with disconnect and bypass offers added motor control at the unit for critical fan applications. With bypass control, power to the VFD can be switched to allow full operation of the fan motor in case of VFD failure. VFDs with disconnect switch, bypass and line reactors provide harmonic control when needed.

# <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Air Handler Selection**

# **Selecting Coils**

The Vision air handler provides the ability to select from multiple face area coils per unit size. Once the coil size is selected, the row and fin requirements can be determined based on performance criteria. Daikin Applied offers an extensive line of coil types and circuitings. This wide variety of circuiting, row, and fin spacing, in addition to different material types, can provide a coil selection that handles the load required.

Heating, cooling, and combination cooling and reheat sections are available. Coil sections come in many different depths to accommodate multiple rows of coils, and to provide access on the leaving air side or between coils for cleaning and inspection of the drain pan. Access in the coil section can be minimized or maximized depending on the space available and job needs. Coil sections can be placed as needed in the unit, and as many sections as required for conditioning of air can be provided.

# **Selecting Accessories**

A complete selection of component and section types in a variety of unit arrangements and configurations is available for air mixing, filtration, and temperature control to meet specific application requirements. The outside and/or return air can be brought into the unit through a plenum, mixing box, or economizer. For mixing of the two air streams, dampers are required to modulate and direct outside and return air, which is accomplished using a mixing box or economizer. Both section types use the Daikin Applied patented UltraSeal™ low leak dampers. Blenders/air mixers also are available to provide proper mixing of two air streams, to prevent stratification and to help avoid damage to equipment due to freezing temperatures.

To promote good air filtration, many different filter media types and arrangements are offered. Filters can be provided in flat filter racks, in a variety of media efficiencies, and with or without a prefilter. The filter section can be located anywhere in the unit to filter air as it enters the unit, or in a final filter arrangement before it leaves the unit. Bag or cartridge filters can be either front or side loading.

Also available are many different size access sections for field-installed components or to provide access between components. Other options include diffusers, plenums, face and bypass dampers, sound attenuators, and blenders/air mixers. Standard access doors open outward for maximum accessibility to internal components.

On pressurized sections, most doors open inward to help maintain the extremely low cabinet leakage rate of the Vision unit and to prevent doors from being inadvertently opened when the cabinet is under pressure.

## **Selecting Fans**

## **WARNING**

## **SMOKE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS**

Improper smoke or fume air handling can result in severe personal injury or death. A registered professional engineer must design and approve the air conditioner and air handler application to make sure smoke and fume control meet local fire codes and NFPA requirements for the specific building application.

Fan selection requires an accurate calculation of the resistance to the airflow through the entire system. This total resistance consists of the sum of two parts—the external and internal static pressure. The external static pressure is the static pressure found in the distribution system, external to the air handler. The internal unit resistance is the sum of the resistance of the coils and various other unit components and accessories. Component pressure drops are listed for specific air flows in this catalog.

Use the Daikin Applied SelectTools software to determine internal component pressure drops of the system. Once the total static pressure is known, the software identifies the fans available to properly handle the air flow and static pressure for the system. The software generates a full fan curve based on the fan selection and point of operation.

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

# **Installation Flexibility**

Daikin Applied central station Vision air handlers feature sectionalized design and can ship fully assembled or in sections as required by the job site condition to provide maximum installation flexibility. Multiple fan, coil, filter, mixing box, face and bypass, and access components allow the design flexibility of built-up systems with the cost advantage of factory fabricated units.

# **Mounting and Access**

Take care to keep the supporting structure level and rigid enough for satisfactory unit operation. Ideally, a heavy concrete slab should be used for floor mounted units.

Locate units so there is proper access for routine service. Clearance for filter removal on both sides of the filter section is usually necessary. Provide clearance as required for access panels. Allow room for coil removal. Cooling units require clearance for a trap in the drain pan line.

Access to the interior of the Vision air handler is provided by hinged access doors or removable panels. For access between components, versatile access sections feature hinged access doors on either or both sides.

## **Ductwork**

A well-designed duct layout minimizes system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow. Avoid discharge plenums or any abrupt change in duct size. Also avoid sharp turns in the fan discharge, particularly turns opposed to wheel rotation. If sharp bends are necessary, use turning vanes. See [Figure 13](#page-20-1) for good fan outlet practices.

<span id="page-20-1"></span>

**NOTE:** Elbows should not be closer than 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the largest dimension of fan discharge opening. Place dampers at least 3 fan diameters downstream of the fan discharge.

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Piping and Drain Pan Traps**

Design and install piping in accordance with accepted industry standards. Do not apply undue stress at the connection to coil headers. Support pipe work independently of the coils with adequate piping flexibility for thermal expansion. Run drain lines and traps full size from the drain pan connection. Drain pans must have traps to allow the condensate from the coils to drain freely. On a draw-through unit, the trap depth and the distance between the trap outlet and drain pan outlet should be twice the negative static pressure under normal unit operation. See [Figure 14](#page-21-1).

### <span id="page-21-1"></span>*Figure 14: Drain Pan Traps*

## **Vibration Isolation**

To help keep noise and vibration compatible with the intended use of the conditioned air space, apply good acoustical and vibration engineering practices during the early stages of design.

Since most applications require vibration isolation, the Vision air handler is available with factory-installed internal isolation. Internally isolated units feature spring isolators sized specifically for each fan wheel and unit size.

## **Sound**

The unit inlet, outlet, and radiated sound levels for each octave band are calculated by the Daikin Applied SelectTools software, based on your specific application. Sound performance data is derived from testing performed in accordance with AMCA Standard 300. The effects of various components, casework, and unit configurations are taken into account.

## **Air Supply Systems and Fan Laws**

An air supply system consists of an air handler cabinet, heat exchanger, filters, ductwork, grilles and registers used to distribute air throughout the building. The system is independent of the fan used to supply the system.

The resistance of the system, referred to as static pressure (SP), is dependent upon the quantity of air (cfm) that is moved through it. The air quantity is determined by the cooling, heating, and ventilating requirements.

For any system, the static pressure varies directly as the square of the air quantity. This relationship between cfm and SP establishes the system curve for that system and is expressed as follows:

$$\left(\frac{\text{cfm}\_1}{\text{cfm}\_2}\right)^2 = \frac{\text{SP}\_1}{\text{SP}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{SP}\_2 \quad = \text{ SP}\_1 \quad \left(\frac{\text{cfm}\_2}{\text{cfm}\_1}\right)^2$$

The system curve is unique for a particular system configuration. Any change to the system caused by dirty filters, damper changes, etc., results in a new system curve.

For fans operating at low pressures (less than 10" W.G.), the effects of air compression are negligible. Disregarding air compression allows fan operation in a fixed system to be expressed by simple relationships. These relationships are known as fan laws and can be used to calculate the effects of fan speed and air density changes on this system.

**1** The flow rate varies directly with the change in fan speed:

$$\mathbf{\underline{cfm}}\_2 = \frac{\mathbf{rpm}\_1}{\mathbf{rpm}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{cfm}\_2 = \mathbf{cfm}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathbf{rpm}\_2}{\mathbf{rpm}\_1}\right)$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases air quantity 10%.

**2** The static pressure varies as the square of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\mathfrak{SP}\_1}{\mathfrak{SP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_1}{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{P}\mathfrak{M}\_2}\right)^2 \text{or} \quad \mathfrak{SP}\_2 = \mathfrak{SP}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_2}{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{P}\mathfrak{M}\_1}\right)^2$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases static pressure 21%.

**3** The fan brake horsepower varies as the cube of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\mathsf{HP}\_1}{\mathsf{HP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}\right)^3 \text{ or } \mathsf{HP}\_2 = \mathsf{HP}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases horsepower 33%.

**4** System static pressure and brake horsepower are directly proportional to the air density:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathsf{SP}\_2 & = & \mathsf{SP}\_1 \quad \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{density}\_2}{\mathsf{density}\_1}\right) \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3 \\\\ \mathsf{HP}\_2 & = & \mathsf{HP}\_1 \quad \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{density}\_2}{\mathsf{density}\_1}\right) \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3 \end{array}$$

<span id="page-22-0"></span>Consequently, the static pressure and brake horsepower decrease with an increase in air temperature or higher altitude, and increase with a decrease in air temperature or lower altitude.

To determine fan performance for temperatures and altitudes other than standard (70°F, 0 ft. altitude), the static pressure must be adjusted by the density ratio before the fan rpm and bhp requirements can be determined. Density ratios are expressed as temperature and altitude conversion factors in [Table 5](#page-22-1).

## **Fan and Motor Heat**

**Motor and drive heat**—The total energy input to any fan motor is consumed in two ways: by heat dissipated through the motor frame and by work output. The amount of heat dissipated by the motor is a function of its operating efficiency:

*Motor heat = input × (1 – motor efficiency)* 

A small amount of the motor work output is dissipated by the drive mechanism, which also results in a heat gain. Belt drive losses are a function of belt tension and number of belts as well as power transmitted. Typical belt drive losses range from 2% to 6% of bhp.

Whether motor and drive heat gain become part of an air handling system cooling load depends on the motor location relative to the conditioned space. For air handlers with internal motors, the motor and drive are within the conditioned space. Therefore, the motor and drive add heat to the system. Subtract this heat from the cooling capacity and add it to the heating capacity of the unit.

**Fan heat generation**—All of the power input to a fan results in heat gain, which must be considered as a cooling load. The amount of heat generated is directly proportional to the fan bhp:

### *Fan heat (Btuh) = bhp × 2545*

Much of this heat generation occurs within the fan itself. Fans are not 100% efficient, and the energy losses that occur convert directly into heat. The work done by the fan on the airstream increases the temperature, pressure, and velocity of air. The heat of compression required to raise the airstream to this increased energy level is also a heat gain.

As the air travels throughout the building, its energy is deteriorated by friction, resulting in pressure drop. This is also heat gain, but it does not result in temperature rise because the air expands as the pressure is reduced. The expansion is a cooling process that offsets the heat generated by friction.

Typical fan and motor heat values are given in [Figure 15](#page-22-2).

Daikin Applied variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This true variable volume system is commonly referred to as a "squeeze-off" or "pinch-off" system. Unlike a "bypass" or "dump" system, supply air is diverted from areas where it is not required to areas that need cooling and, at system part load conditions, reduces the total fan volume. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lowers system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes.
- Lowers operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions.
- Lowers first cost by reducing space requirements for duct trunks and mechanical equipment.
- Provides system flexibility to match changing occupancy demands.

<span id="page-23-0"></span>## **Variable Frequency Drives**

Variable frequency drives offer reliable operation over a wide range of airflow, with advantages in sound and energy performance.

Variable frequency drives provide the most efficient means of variable volume control by taking advantage of the fan law relation between fan speed (rpm) and fan brake horsepower (bhp). Also, since airflow is reduced by changing fan speed, the noise penalties often associated with mechanical control devices, e.g. inlet vanes, are not introduced. The following equation illustrates how fan bhp varies as the cube of the change in fan speed:

$$\mathsf{HP}\_2 = \mathsf{HP}\_1 \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{density}\_2}{\mathsf{density}\_1}\right) \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3$$

In an ideal system, at 50% fan speed, brake horsepower would be reduced to 12.5% of that at full speed.

Variable frequency control varies the speed of the fan by adjusting the frequency and voltage to the motor. Keeping a constant volts/frequency ratio (constant magnetic flux) to the motor allows the motor to run at its peak efficiency over a wide range of speeds and resulting fan airflow volumes. [Figure 16](#page-23-1) illustrates on a fan curve the effect of varying air volume with a variable frequency drive.

### *Figure 17: Coil Air Pressure Drop—HI-F5 Fin Type (2 Through 12 Rows)*

#### Notes:

• The letters A,B,C,D or E following the face velocity indicate the degree of wetness at which the coil is operating.

• Dry coils are shown by the letter A, wet coils by the letter E. Intermediate conditions are shown by the letters B, C, and D.

• Air pressure drop for odd fin spacings can be found by interpolation.

# <span id="page-43-0"></span>**Electrical Data**

## **Supply Power Wiring**

- 1. Units required three phase power supply.
- 2. Allowable voltage tolerances:
	- a. 60 Hertz

Nameplate 208 V: Min. 187 V, max. 229 V Nameplate 230 V: Min. 207 V, max. 253 V Nameplate 460 V: Min. 414 V, max. 506 V Nameplate 575 V: Min. 518 V, max. 633 V

- 3. **Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) calculation:**
- **NOTE:** If a unit is provided with multiple power connections, each must be considered alone in selecting power wiring components.
- For units with cooling and heating:
- *MCA = 1.25 × largest load + sum of all other loads*
- **NOTE:** Control circuit ampacity does not need to be considered in the calculation for wire sizing ampacity. If the unit is provided with one or more fan section lights, they are powered from the separate 15 amp (minimum), 120 V supply required by the NEC for the unit convenience outlet.
	- 4. Size wires in accordance with Table 310-16 or 310-19 of the National Electrical Code.
	- 5. Wires should be sized for a maximum of 3% voltage drop.
