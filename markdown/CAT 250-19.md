The display is a 4-line by 20 character format with clear English display messages. All operating conditions, system alarms, control parameters and schedules can be monitored from the keypad/display. If the correct password has been entered, any adjustable parameter or schedule can be modified from the keypad.

#### *Figure 16: Keypad/Display Interface*

### **Unit Sensors**

### *Temperature and Enthalpy Sensors*

The return, discharge, and outside air temperature sensors are factory installed. The zone temperature sensor package can be ordered as a field installed option.

### *Zone Temperature Sensors*

Two optional zone temperature sensors are available:

- 1. Zone sensor with tenant override.
- 2. Zone sensor with tenant override and remote set point adjustment.

Timed tenant override is a standard MicroTech control feature.

Zone sensors are required for the controller's space reset of supply air set point and night setback features. All zone sensors are field installed with field wiring terminated at the unit controller.

The optional comparative enthalpy control economizer package is provided with the enthalpy sensor for the return air and outside air factory installed.

### *Static Pressure Transducers*

When the Daikin Applied Packaged System is ordered with the VAV option, the duct static pressure transducer is factory installed as standard. The units can also have an exhaust fan option. The exhaust fans on VAV units are controlled by the building static pressure control package. The exhaust fans on CAV units are controlled by either the building static pressure control package as mentioned above, or they are controlled by the DDC program based on the outside air damper position. The static pressure transducers are factory installed when building static pressure control is ordered. The installation and routing of the field-supplied sampling tubes is done at the time of the unit installation.

### **Stand-Alone Controller Features**

MicroTech rooftop unit controls include all of the essential features required to make them capable of independent and stand-alone operation.

### *Auto/Manual Operation Selection*

Automatic or manual operation can be controlled at the keypad. The keypad provides a variety of occupancy and auto/ manual control mode selections available to the operator:


### *Cooling and Heating Lockout Control*

All unit controls include separate keypad-programmable set points for locking out mechanical cooling and heating. Mechanical cooling is locked out when the outdoor temperature is below the cooling lockout set point. Heating is locked out when the outdoor temperature is above the heating lockout set point. This feature can save energy cost by eliminating unnecessary heating and cooling during periods when the outdoor air temperature is mild.

### *Night/Unoccupied Setback*

When one of the zone temperature sensors is connected to them unit controller, night setback heating control and night setback cooling control are available. Separate, keypadprogrammable, night heating and night cooling set points are used to start the unit when necessary. After the unit starts, night setback control is similar to normal occupied control except that the minimum outside air damper position is set to zero. If the outside air is suitable for free cooling, it is used during night setback operation.

### *Internal Time Clock*

An internal time clock is included in the MicroTech unit controller. Current date and time can be quickly and easily set at the user interface keypad.

18------------------------------------------------



### *Internal Schedule*

Seven daily schedules and holiday schedules can be entered at the keypad of all unit controllers. For each of these eight schedules, one start and one stop time can be entered. Up to 16 holiday periods of any duration can be designated. The unit will automatically run according to the holiday schedule on the holiday dates.

In lieu of its internal schedule, the unit can be operated according to a network schedule from a BAS.

### *External Time Clock or Tenant Override Input*

An input is supplied that can be used to accept a field wired start/stop signal from a remote source. An external time clock, a tenant override switch, or both may be connected. Whenever the external circuit is closed, the controller overrides the internal schedule (if activated) and places the unit into the occupied mode.

If the internal schedule or a BAS network schedule is used, field wiring is not required.

### *Timed Tenant Override*

Off-hour operation flexibility is a must in today's office environments and the stand-alone MicroTech controls handle it with ease. When unit operation is desired during unoccupied hours the tenant override button on either of the optional zone sensor packages is pressed to initiate the override operation. The unit then starts and runs in the occupied mode for a keypad-adjustable length of time (up to five hours). If the button is pressed again while the unit is operating, the timer resets to the full time allowance without interrupting unit operation. Tenant override operation can also be initiated by a BAS.

### *Remote Set Point Adjustment Options*

 All constant air volume-zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC) unit controllers include an input that can be used to remotely adjust the zone cooling and heating set points. To use this feature, wire the optional zone sensor package with set point adjustment to the controller. The remote set point adjustment feature can be enabled or disabled from the keypad at any time. When enabled, the remote set point adjustment is available even if the return temperature is selected to be the control temperature.

The building automation system (BAS) can also remotely adjust the unit's setpoints.

## **Standard Control Options**

 MicroTech controls offer two basic control configurations; (1) variable air volume with discharge temperature control (VAVDTC) or (2) constant air volume with zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC).

All control configurations use sophisticated state change control logic to provide stable, reliable and efficient control. When combined with MicroTech's many available control capabilities–both factory installed and keypad programmable– these basic configurations can be customized to meet the requirements of the most demanding applications.

### *Configuration 1: Variable Air Volume with Discharge Temperature Control (VAV-DTC)*

 MicroTech VAV-DTC controls provide discharge air temperature control along with duct static pressure control. The operator can enter the desired cooling set point and VAV parameters at the keypad.

### *Configuration 2: Constant Air Volume with ZoneTemperature Control (CAV-ZTC)*

 MicroTech CAV-ZTC controls provide the sophisticated and flexible zone temperature control that is only possible with DDC systems. Zone temperature sensors are available with or without a remote set point adjustment. With the remote adjustment model, the space set point can be set at the keypad or at the zone sensor package. (Even if a zone sensor is connected, remote set point adjustment can be enabled or disabled as desired at the keypad.)

### *Control Temperature*

 The Control Temperature for VAV-DTC or CAV-ZTC determines whether the unit supplies heating, cooling, or neither. It also determines the amount of heating or cooling required to satisfy the load. Its source can be selected at the keypad from among the following selections:

- Zone temperature sensor
- Return temperature sensor

### *Supply Air Reset*

 By automatically varying the discharge air temperature to suit a building's cooling or heating needs, supply air temperature reset can increase the energy efficiency of VAV systems. MicroTech controllers offer a variety of different reset strategies that can be selected at the keypad. Because they are keypadprogrammable, reset strategies can be changed or eliminated as desired. Separate strategies can be selected for both cooling and heating. If reset is not desired, a fixed discharge cooling or heating set point can be entered.

The following reset methods are available:

- Space temperature
- Return temperature
- Outdoor air temperature
- Supply airflow (VAV, cooling set point only)
- External 0–10 V (dc) or 0–20 mA signal
- Network communication

For all temperature reset methods, the minimum and maximum cooling and heating set points are keypad programmable along with the corresponding minimum and maximum space, return or outdoor air temperature parameters. For the supply airflow method, the discharge set point will be reset as the supply fan modulates between 30% (adjustable) and 100% (adjustable). For the external method, the discharge set point will be reset as the voltage or current signal varies over its entire range. For units in a BAS network, the discharge set points are reset via the communication signal.

19------------------------------------------------



### **Compressor Control**

### *Compressor Staging*

Compressor staging is controlled directly by the control temperature. When the control temperature is warmer than the cooling set point, cooling is staged up; when the control temperature is cooler than the cooling set point, cooling is staged down. However, a stage change can only occur when the control temperature is outside the dead band. Staging is constrained by an inter-stage delay timer (five minute default setting) and minimum and maximum discharge air temperature limits (all keypad programmable). These constraints protect the compressors from short cycling while eliminating temperature variations near the diffusers.

### *Project Ahead Algorithm*

Because of the inherent thermal inertia in a building, zone temperature control applications can cause overshoot during warm-up or cool-down periods, MicroTech features a "Project Ahead" control algorithm. "Project Ahead" calculates the rate at which the control temperature is changing and reduces the unit's cooling or heating output as the zone temperature nears its set point, essentially eliminating overshoot.

### *Energy Recovery Control*

The energy recovery wheel option has integrated control with the units DDC controller. Temperature sensors are mounted at the wheel to coordinate its operation with the rooftop unit. The outdoor air temperature, leaving wheel temperature, return air temperature, and exhaust air temperature are connected to the rooftop unit controller. These temperatures are also available as BACnet variables for the BAS integration option. The operational performance of the wheel and unit is maximized with this integrated control. The benefit of the integrated control is that it will montior the leaving wheel temperature and prevent the wheel operation from overheating the outdoor air, which will force the building into the cooling mode of operation and consume more energy.

Frost control can be provided by a number of options. The standard offering for frost protection is to stop the wheel when a frost condition is encountered. The second option is to have the start-stop-jog control to prevent the wheel from reaching a frost condition. The third option for frost control is VFD proportional control. The speed of the wheel is varied to prevent the wheel from entering a frost condition. This option maximizes the amount of energy savings and also prevents the frost condition.

## **Supply Fan Control**

### *Duct Static Pressure Control*

On all VAV-DTC units, duct static pressure control is maintained by a control algorithm which provides precise control of the supply fan variable frequency drive. The keypad programmable set point can be set between 0.20ʺ wc and 2.0" wc.

### **Economizer Control**

### *Economizer Changeover Selection*

On units equipped with an economizer, there are two methods of determining whether the outdoor air is suitable for free cooling.

- The standard offering uses an internal dry bulb changeover strategy: the unit controller compares the outdoor air dry- bulb temperature to a keypadprogrammable set point
- The optional second method is a comparative enthalpy control. It uses a solid state device that compares the outdoor air ambient enthalpy to the return air enthalpy. When the outdoor air enthalpy is lower than the return air enthalpy, the unit will change to economizer operation

### *Minimum Ventilation Air Volume Control*

Consistently maintaining the minimum outdoor air requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62 has been a long- standing control challenge for VAV systems. As supply air fan volumes were reduced, the volume of air introduced through a fixed-position, minimum outdoor air damper was also reduced, compromising indoor air quality. To meet this challenge, MicroTech controls feature user-selected control methods for maintaining outdoor air volume.

MicroTech controls have a keypad-selected control function that automatically adjusts outdoor air damper position in response to changes in supply air fan volume. Regardless of supply air volume, this strategy maintains a nearly constant outdoor air volume at all times.

The outdoor air damper position can also be controlled by the following:

- The MicroTech controller can accept an external 0–10 V (dc) or a 0–20 mA signal from a control device or from a CO2 sensor
- The MicroTech controller can accept a BAS network signal for the minimum position
- A fixed minimum damper position can be keypad programmed. This selection may be acceptable when ventilation requirements are met through other sources. During cold ambient conditions where the mixed air temperature of the minimum outdoor air and the return air can become too low, MicroTech controls maintain the minimum discharge temperature set point by controlling the unit's heating system

### **Exhaust Fan Control**

### *Building Static Pressure Control*

 Any constant or variable air volume Maverick unit with an optional variable volume exhaust fan can be provided with direct building static pressure control capability. The building static pressure is measured and processed by the unit DDC controller. The controller provides precise control of the exhaust fan's variable speed drive to maintain the space pressure set point. The range of the keypad-programmable set point is between –0.25ʺ and +0.25" wc.

## **Field Output Signals**

 All MicroTech controls include two solid-state relay outputs that are available for field connection to any suitable device: a remote alarm output and a fan operation output. These outputs are used to signal field equipment of unit status.

### *Remote Alarm Output*

 The remote alarm output can be used to operate a 24 V relay to provide a remote alarm signal to a light, audible alarm, or other device when an alarm condition exists at the unit.

### *Fan Operation Output*

The fan operation output is used to operate a 24 V relay to control field equipment that depends on fan operation, such as field-installed isolation dampers or VAV boxes. To allow actuators enough time to stroke, the fan operation output is energized three minutes before the fan starts. It then remains energized until thirty seconds after the unit airflow switch senses no airflow. The fan operation output is on whenever the unit airflow switch senses airflow.

### **Alarm Management and Control**

MicroTech unit controllers are capable of sophisticated alarm management and controlled response functions. Each alarm is prioritized, indicated, and responded to with the appropriate action. The current alarm (up to four alarms, arranged by alarm priority), each with a time and date stamp, can be displayed at the user interface.

### *Alarm Priority*

The various alarms that can occur are prioritized according to the severity of the problem. Three alarm categories are used: (1) Faults, (2) Problems, and (3) Warnings.

- 1. Faults are the highest priority alarms. If a fault condition occurs, the complete unit is shut down until the alarm condition is gone and the fault is manually cleared at the keypad. A fault example is a "Fan Fail" alarm.
- 2. Problems are the next lower priority to faults. If a problem occurs, the complete unit does not shut down, but its operation is modified to compensate for the alarm condition. A problem automatically clears when the alarm condition that caused it is gone. "Lo Pres-Ckt1" is an example of a problem where only the affected compressor is shut down.
- 3. Warnings are the lowest priority alarms. No control action is taken when a warning occurs; it is simply indicated to alert the operator that the alarm condition needs attention. To remind the operator to read warnings, they must be manually cleared. "Dirty Filter" indication is an example of a warning.

# <span id="page-21-2"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

## **General Rooftop Applications**

Units are intended for use in normal heating, ventilating, and air conditioning applications. Consult your local Daikin Applied sales representative for applications involving operation at high ambient temperatures, high altitudes, non- cataloged voltages, and for job specific unit selections that fall outside of the range of the catalog tables.

For proper operation, units should be rigged in accordance with instructions stated in [IM 842](http://www.DaikinApplied.com). Fire dampers, if required, must be installed in the ductwork according to local or state codes. No space is allowed for these dampers in the unit. Follow factory check, test and start procedures explicitly to achieve satisfactory start-up and operation (see [IM 842](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)).

Most rooftop applications take advantage of the significant energy savings provided with economizer operation. When an economizer system is used, mechanical refrigeration is typically not required below an ambient temperature of 50°F. Standard MPS refrigeration systems are designed to operate in ambient temperatures down to 20°F for 15–50 ton units or 45°F for 61–75 ton units. Maverick units with inverter compressors can provide mechanical cooling down to 35°F on 30–35 ton units and 0°F on 40–50 ton units.

*Figure 17: MPS 015–075 Service Clearances (030 Shown)* 

### **Unit Location**

The structural engineer must verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Take extreme caution when using a wooden roof structure.

Unit condenser coils should be located to avoid contact with any heated exhaust air.. If the unit is located in a corrosive environment, such as near the sea coast or industrial fumes, then, optional coated condenser coils are required.

Allow sufficient space around the unit for maintenance/service clearance. Refer to [Figure 17](#page-21-1) for recommended clearances. Consult your Daikin Applied sales representative if available clearances do not meet minimum recommendations. Where code considerations, such as the NEC, require extended clearances, they take precedence.

<span id="page-21-1"></span>

22------------------------------------------------



### **Service Clearance**

Allow recommended service clearances as shown in Figure 13. Provide a roof walkway along the sides of the unit for service and access to controls and components. Contact your Daikin Applied sales representative for service requirements less than those recommended.

## **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16ʺ per foot side to side). A sub-base has to be constructed by the contractor in applications involving pitched roofs. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. Typical curb installation is illustrated in [Figure 56 on page 61](#page-60-1) and [Figure 65 on page 70](#page-69-1). In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side. In addition the insulation on the underside of the unit should also be protected from the elements.

Applications in geographic areas subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

### **Acoustical Considerations**

Good acoustical design is critical for any installation and should start at the earliest stages in the design process. Common sound paths for rooftop equipment must be addressed are:

- Radiated sound through the bottom of the unit (air handling section and condensing section) and into the space
- Radiated sound to the property line
- Structure-borne vibration from the unit to the building
- Airborne sound through the supply air duct
- Airborne sound through the return air duct

Locating rooftop equipment away from sound sensitive areas is critical and the most cost effective means of avoiding sound problems. If possible, rooftop equipment should always be located over less sensitive areas such as corridors, toilet facilities or auxiliary spaces and away from office areas, conference rooms and classrooms.

Some basic guidelines for good acoustical performance are:

- Provide proper structural support under all areas of the unit
- Always locate the unit's center of gravity close to a main support to minimize roof deflection
- Use a concrete deck or pad when a unit has to be located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential
- Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking within the curb perimeter, and the openings must be sealed once the duct is installed
- Don't overlook the return air path. Never leave a clear "line of sight" into a return or exhaust fan; always include some duct work (acoustically lined tee) at the return inlet
- Place an acoustical material in the area directly beneath the condensing section
- Select acoustical material that discourages microbial growth
- Minimize system static pressure losses to reduce fan sound generation
- Design duct systems to minimize turbulence
- Account for low frequency duct breakout in system design. Route the first 20 ft. of rectangular duct over non-sensitive areas and avoid large duct aspect ratios. Consider round or oval duct to reduce breakout

There are many sound sources in rooftop systems. Fans, compressors, condenser fans, duct take-offs, etc., all generate sound. For guidelines on reducing sound generation in the duct system, refer to the ASHRAE Applications Handbook.

Contact your local Daikin Applied sales representative for equipment supply, return and radiated sound power data specific to your application.

### **Ductwork Considerations**

A well-designed duct system is required to allow the rooftop equipment to provide rated performance and to minimize system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow transitions. Avoid any abrupt change in duct size and sharp turns in the fan discharge. Avoid turns opposed to wheel rotation since they generate air turbulence and result in unwanted sound. If 90° turns are necessary, use turning vanes. Refer to the ASHRAE Applications Handbook for specific guidelines relevant to rooftop equipment.

### *Return Duct*

The return path is the most often overlooked. A section of return duct is required to avoid a "line of sight" to the return air opening and to provide attenuation of return air sound. Install an insulated tee with a maximum duct velocity of 1000 to 1200 feet per minute. Extend the duct 15 feet to provide adequate attenuation.

23------------------------------------------------



### *Supply Duct*

Insulate supply air ductwork for at least the first 20 feet from the unit. Consider the use of round or oval ductwork, as it significantly reduces low frequency breakout noise near the equipment. If rectangular duct is used, keep the aspect ratio of the duct as low as possible. The large flat surfaces associated with high aspect ratios increase low frequency breakout to the space and can generate noise, such as "oil canning." The maximum recommended supply duct velocity is 1800 to 2000 feet per minute.

### *Duct High Limit*

A Daikin Applied Packaged System with VAV control includes a duct high limit switch as a standard feature that is of particular importance when fast acting, normally closed boxes are used.

### *Vibration Isolation*

Make duct attachments to the unit with a flexible connection.

### **Economizer and Exhaust Fan Application**

Rooftop economizer applications usually require exhaust fans to properly control building pressure and maintain minimum ventilation.

The air balancer must adjust the outdoor air damper to provide minimum ventilation settings.

The EAF is normally off during non-economizer operation. During these minimum outdoor air conditions, the system essentially acts like a supply fan only system.

## **Smoke and Fire Protection**

Due to the wide variation in building design and ambient operating conditions into which our units are applied, we do not represent or warrant that our products are fit and sufficient for smoke, fume, and fire control purposes. The owner and a fully qualified building designer are responsible for meeting all local and NFPA building code requirements with respect to smoke, fume, and fire control.

The unit's control panel has a terminal block that a supply air and return air smoke detector can be wired to. An optional return air smoke detector is offered. Any other smoke detector, its installation, and the wiring to the unit controller are all field supplied.

### **Variable Air Volume Application**

MPS units are available with variable speed drives to provide variable air volume (VAV) control as shown in Figure 14.

Daikin Applied MPS variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature, thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lower system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes
- Lower operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions
- Acoustical sound performance is reduced at the lower airflows

### *Figure 18: Variable Air Volume (VAV) Control*

In placing a duct static pressure sensor, locate a pressure tap near the end of the main duct trunk. Adjust the static pressure set point so that at minimum airflow all of the terminals receive the minimum static pressure required plus any downstream resistance. Locate the static pressure sensor tap in the ductwork in an area free from turbulence effects and at least ten duct diameters downstream and several duct diameters upstream from any major interference, including branch takeoffs.

### **Fan Isolation**

All Daikin Applied MPS systems feature internally isolated fans. All supply fans are statically and dynamically balanced in the factory. 15–50 ton unit springs have 1ʺ deflection and 61–75 ton unit springs have 2ʺ deflection. Flexible isolation is provided as standard between the fan and bulkhead to prevent hard contact and vibration transmission.

When using an isolation curb, consult with the curb manufacturer to confirm no resonant vibration situation can occur between the fan and roof curb.

Normally, 15–50 ton unit springs are left in the tied down position. Optional rubber and shear isolators should be ordered for 61–75 ton units.

## **Fan Operating Range**

The acceptable system operating range of the Daikin Applied rooftop is determined by all of the following characteristics. Each of these limiting factors must be considered for proper performance and component design life:

- Unstable fan operation
- Maximum fan rpm
- Maximum cabinet static pressure
- Maximum face velocity (cooling coil is most important)
- Minimum furnace velocity
- Turndown capability on VAV applications
- Compressor operating pressures

### **Indoor Fan and Motor Heat**

The indoor fan and motor electrical consumption is a sensible cooling load approximately equal to 2.8 MBh per bhp (depending slightly on motor efficiency). The fan and motor temperature rise is equal to Btuh/(1.08 × cfm) and is typically about 3°F.

### **Ambient Operating Ranges for Compressors**

Maverick MPS II units have two independent refrigerant circuits with one to three condenser fans on each circuit depending on unit size. Head pressure is maintained by cycling condenser fans of each refrigeration circuit automatically in response to ambient air temperature.

- Maverick II 15-50 ton units allows mechanical cooling operation down to 0°F ambient temperatures for fixed speed scroll unit
- Maverick II 26-50 ton units with variable speed scroll compressor allows mechanical cooling operation down to 35°F on 30–35 ton units and 0°F on 40–50 ton units
- Maverick II 61-75 ton units allows mechanical cooling operation down to 45°F ambient temperatures and 0°F ambient temperatures for unit with variable speed condenser fan, low ambient option

### **Altitude Adjustments**

### *Fan Curve Performance*

Fan curve performance is based on 70°F air temperature and sea level elevation. Selections at any other conditions require adjustment for air densities listed in Table 2. Higher elevations generally require more rpm to provide a given static pressure but less bhp due to the decrease in air density.

#### **Example:**

Assume 12,000 cfm is required at 2.0ʺ TSP. The elevation is 5000 ft. and 70°F average air temperature is selected. A 24ʺ SWSI airfoil fan is selected.

- 1. The density adjustment factor for 5000 ft. and 70°F is 0.83.
- 2. TSP must be adjusted as follows: 2.0ʺ / 0.83 = 2.4ʺ.
- 3. Locate 12,000 cfm and 2.4 on the fan curve. Rpm = 1700 and bhp = 9.
- 4. Consumed fan power at design = 9 bph × 0.83 = 7.5 bhp.

#### *Table 2: Temperature and Altitude Conversion Factors*


25------------------------------------------------



### **Condenser Performance**

Altitudes greater than sea level require a derate in condenser and cooling performance that can be estimated as follows:

For altitudes up to 6000 feet:

- Cooling capacity decrease factor (all sizes) = 0.5% per 1000 feet
- Compressor kW increase factor = 0.6% per 1000 feet

For altitudes above 6000 feet, consult the factory. The actual derate varies with each individual unit and design conditions. Your local Daikin Applied representative can provide exact performance data.

## **Furnace Performance**

Gas heat performance data is based on standard 70°F air temperature and zero feet altitude (sea level).

For altitudes between 2000 to 6000 feet, the gas burner must be derated 4% for every 1000 feet of altitude.

### **Example:**

A 400 MBh furnace at an altitude of 3000 feet is derated (0.04 × 3 = 0.12). At 400 MBh input (400 × 0.12 MBh), the actual input is (400 - 48 = 352 MBh) at 3000 feet.

For altitudes above 6000 feet, consult the factory.

## **System Operating Limits**

Daikin Applied MPS systems are designed to operate over an extensive operating range. However, for proper system operation some limits do apply.

To help prevent moisture blow-off, design guidelines have been established for cooling coil selection. Based on laboratory testing, average coil face velocities should not exceed 600 ft./min. For applications outside of these limits, consult your Daikin Applied sales representative.

In addition to maximum face velocity limitations, minimum velocity guidelines must also be followed. In order to maintain proper refrigeration performance, the minimum coil face velocity is 175 ft./min. When selecting a variable air volume unit, it is necessary to design the system such that the 175 ft./ min. limit is maintained at light load conditions.

## **Condensate Drainage**

Provide all drain pans with a properly sized p-trap to allow free drainage of coil condensate. For trap sizing, follow instruction given in [IM 842](http://www.DaikinApplied.com). Run all traps and drain lines full size from the threaded unit connection to the roof drain.

### **Zone Sensor Placement**

Placement of the zone temperature sensor is critical for proper and economical operation of the heating and cooling system. It is generally recommended that the space sensor be located on an inside wall (3 to 5 feet from an outside wall) in a space having a floor area of at least 400 square feet. Do not locate the sensor below the outlet of a supply diffuser, in the direct rays of the sun, on a wall adjacent to an unheated or abnormally warm room (boiler or incinerator room), or near any heat producing equipment. Where zone sensor placement is a problem, all zone control systems, as standard, have the capability to use a return air sensor for heating and cooling.

## **Unit Wiring**

All units require three phase, 60 Hz, 208, 230, 460, or 575 volt power supply. All units include branch circuits and short circuit protection and are available with a power block or non- fused disconnect switch. Each unit is provided with a 115V convenience outlet. Per the NEC, this circuit must be fed independent of the main unit power supply.

All wiring must be installed in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) and local codes.

### **Winter Shipment**

Flat bed shipment in winter can expose units to harsh road chemicals. Since equipment size and configuration precludes covering during transit, wash units free of these chemicals as soon as possible to help prevent corrosion.

## **Coil Freeze Protection**

When applying roof-mounted equipment in areas that experience subfreezing conditions, coil freeze protection measures must be provided. Subfreezing temperatures can adversely affect water and steam coils during controlled or uncontrolled unit shutdowns and even during unit operation. Daikin Applied economizer dampers are arranged to direct the outside and return air streams toward each other, however, there may not always be a uniform unit temperature profile under all load and ambient temperatures. Some temperature stratification will occur, particularly at low ambient temperatures and the associated reduced airflow inherent with VAV systems.

Glycol is strongly recommended as a positive means of freeze protection for water coils. No control sequence can prevent coil freezing in the event of a power failure or equipment malfunction. During those periods, glycol is the only positive means of freeze protection. When selecting water coils, specify glycol to account for performance differences.

Freeze protection control strategies must be designed to keep unit cabinet temperatures from exceeding 150°F during a unit shutdown. Temperatures in excess of 150°F may exceed the design limits of motors, electrical components, gaskets, etc. potentially leading to premature failure of components.

<span id="page-26-0"></span># **Unit Selection**

### **Achieving Optimal Performance**

Achieving the optimal performance of a rooftop system requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that control the unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation and air filtration requirements, heating and cooling loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and installation limitations.

The Daikin Applied SelectTools™ software selection program allows your local Daikin Applied sales representative to provide you with fast, accurate and complete selection of Daikin Applied MPS units. You also can select your unit through reference to physical, performance, dimensional, and unit weight data included in this catalog.

To properly select unit equipment:

- 1. Select unit size and cooling coil.
- 2. Select heating coils and equipment.
- 3. Select fans and motors.

Below are examples that illustrate the equations and catalog references used in the unit selection process.

### <span id="page-26-1"></span>*Table 3: Selection Example*


### *Selecting Unit Size to Satisfy Summer Design*

Unit size is based on coil face area and cooling capacity requirements. Supply air capacity and maximum face velocity constraints should serve as a guide for selecting coil dimensions and cabinet size.

Based on the given data in [Table 3,](#page-26-1) the appropriate coil face area may be determined as follows:


**NOTE:** Unit data is based on standard air conditions of 70°F at sea level. Refer to [Application Considerations on](#page-21-2)  [page 22](#page-21-2) for temperature/altitude conversion factors for nonstandard conditions.

Referring to [Physical Data on page 29](#page-28-1), the 29.4 square foot coil of the MPS 040A unit satisfies the required face velocity.

Using the [Performance Data on page 33](#page-32-1), the unit selection is an MPS 040A. Unit performance equals 457,000 Btu/hr. total, 350,000 Btu/hr. Sensible.

Supply air dry bulb = 80°F – 350 MBh/(1.085 × 14,000 cfm) = 57.0°F

Once the initial unit selection is made, determine the actual supply fan heat rise and check and verify the selection for net capacity and supply air temperature.

### *Selecting the Unit Heating System*

Heating equipment and coils can be specified directly from figures and tables incorporated in [Hot Water Heating Capacity](#page-32-2)  [on page 33](#page-32-2).

### *Calculating Total Heating Load*

Total heating load = Space heating load + Outdoor air load – Supply fan heat

From the data given in [Table 3,](#page-26-1) the outdoor air load is (1.085 × 2800)

(70 – 10) / 1000 = 182 MBh and supply fan heat is 46 MBh.

Total heat load = 315 MBh + 182 MBh – 46 MBh = 451 MBh

### **Selecting Fans and Motors**

Fan and motor selections are based on total static pressure drop and design airflow. Total static pressure includes internal air pressure drops of unit components and external air pressure drops in supply and return ducts. Refer to [Pressure](#page-34-1)  [Drops on page 35](#page-34-1) for internal pressure drops of unit components.

When selecting unit fans and motors, use the fan curves provided in [Figure 36](#page-45-0) and [Figure 37 on page 46](#page-45-1).

Select the motor size most closely above the application brake horsepower. (Example: For an application brake horsepower of 7 bhp, select a 7.5 hp motor). An oversized motor (large horsepower to load ratio) can greatly increase electric consumption due to the reduction in motor performance.

### *Exhaust Fan and Motor*

Exhaust fans must be sized for maximum exhaust cfm and return duct ESP at those conditions. See [Hot Water Pressure](#page-41-1)  [Drop Curves on page 42](#page-41-1) for more information.

### *Supply Fan and Motor*

Since the system in [Table 3](#page-26-1) includes a return fan, the return duct static pressure drop is not added to the supply fan pressure drop. Therefore, the total static pressure for the supply fan in [Table 3](#page-26-1) is as follows:

#### **Internal pressure drops:**


Total static pressure = internal drops + external drops

= 1.16 + 2.00

$$=\text{ 3.16-in. w.g.}$$

Entering the MPS 040A fan curve at 14,000 cfm and 3.16-in. w.g., the required fan motor size is 15 hp operating at 1325 rpm. Fan brake horsepower is 12.9 horsepower.

The total fan and motor heat for the supply fan is as follows:

(12.9) bhp × 2.8 MBh/bhp = 36 MBh

### *Additional Weights When Selecting Motors*

[Table 4](#page-27-0) and [Table 5](#page-27-1) lists additional weights when selecting a motor and exhaust fan. See [Physical Data on page 29](#page-28-1) for base unit weights, capacities and physical data.

#### <span id="page-27-0"></span>*Table 4: Additional Weights When Selecting Motors/ Exhaust Fans (015–020 units)*


<span id="page-27-1"></span>



**NOTE:** See [Table 34 on page 82](#page-81-1) for additional weights on 61–75 ton units.

### **Supply Power Wiring for Units Without Electric Heat**

Sizing supply power wire for a unit is based on the circuit with the largest amperage draw. All electrical equipment is wired to a central panel for single or optional multipower connections. Refer to [Electrical Data on page 83](#page-82-1) for FLA and RLA ratings of equipment. Determination of Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) for a 460 V unit with standard condenser fans and R410A is as follows:

### *Fans and Cooling*

MCA = 1.25 × (RLA or FLA of largest motor) + FLA of all other loads

#### **Example:** FLA/RLA

- Compressor 1, 2, 3 = 16.5, 16.5, 14 amps
- Condenser fan motors, (3) 1 hp = 2 amps ea.

Supply fan motor, 15 hp = 17.7 amps

Controls = 1 amps

#### **Therefore,**

MCA = (1.25 × 17.7) + 16.5 + 16.5 + 14.0 + (3 × 2) + 1 = 76 amps

**NOTE:** In the above example, the selected power supply wire is based on 90 amperes.

<span id="page-81-0"></span>The following tables detail unit weights for the MPS 061–075 ton units.

## **MPS 061–075 Unit Weights**


<span id="page-81-1"></span>*Table 34: MPS 061 to 075 (lbs.)* 

Note: Basic unt consists of return air plenum, angular filter section, supply air fan section without fan or motor, cooling section without coil, and condensing unit.

## **6-Row Coil and HGRH Coil Weights**

#### *Table 35: Coil Weights*


## **Fan Motor Weights**

#### *Table 36: Supply, Exhaust and Return Fan Motors*


## **Roof Curb Weights**

Calculate the weight of the unit curb using the following equations:

### *Weight Formula*

Base curb wt. (lb.) = 170 + 0.74 [170 + 2 × curb length (in.)] + additional weight (steps 1-3 below) as required

**NOTE:** Curb length does not include condenser length.

### *Additional Weights*

- 1. For bottom return opening, add 91 lbs.
- 2. For bottom discharge opening, add 78 lbs.
- 3. Cross supports:
	- For curb length greater than 288 in., add 30 lbs.

### *Example: MPS 070E with Gas Heat*


= 10,138 lbs

#### **Liner calculations**

Section


= 650 lbs.

**NOTE:** For structural purposes, consider roof curb weight.
