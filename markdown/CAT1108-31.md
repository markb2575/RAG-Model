Single phase units are also rated for use with HACR circuit breakers.

### *Optional non-fused disconnect switch*

This factory-installed option includes the addition of a 2 or 3-pole switch mounted on the unit. The switch has a lockout/ tag out feature. The switch is rated to handle the unit only (not to include additional amperage from field installed accessories).

# Optional non-fused

# **Compressor**

Daikin Enfinity water source heat pumps are designed around the most advanced compressors in the industry. A wide variety of compressor types are used to offer the best system design for the dedicated refrigerants and tonnage. This allows Daikin Enfinity water source heat pumps to deliver rated capacity with low noise levels.

Rotary compressor are used in unit sizes 007 to 015. Unit sizes 019 to 070 use a scroll compressor.

# **Reversing Valve**

A 4-way reversing valve is included with all Daikin Enfinity water source heat pumps. The valve is energized in the heating mode and will "fail-safe" to the cooling mode which is the predominant mode of operation for commercial applications.

### *Figure 12: 4-way reversing valve*

# **Drain Pan**

Daikin horizontal heat pumps come standard with a Polypropylene (PP), corrosion-resistant plastic drain pan to promote good indoor air quality. The pan is double sloped for positive draining to reduce the occurrence of standing water and microbial growth.

### *Figure 11: Corrosion-resistant, double-sloped plastic drain pan*

# **Thermal Expansion Valve**

All Daikin Enfinity water source heat pump units include a thermal expansion valve for refrigerant metering. The Thermal Expansion Valve (TXV) allows the unit to operate at optimum efficiency with fluid temperatures ranging from 30ºF to 110ºF, and entering air temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 90ºF. The TXV precisely meters the exact amount of refrigerant flow through the system to meet the load and deliver rated heating and cooling capacity.

### *Figure 13: Thermal expansion valve (TXV)*

10------------------------------------------------



# **Fluid-to-Refrigerant Coil**

The copper or cupronickel (optional) tube-in-tube coaxial heat exchanger used in Daikin Enfinity water source heat pumps are designed for maximum heat transfer at normal and low water flow rates with minimum pressure drop. The inside tube is deeply fluted to enhance heat transfer and minimize fouling. All coaxial coils are tested to 500 psig on the water side and 600 psig on the refrigerant side. Extended (geothermal) range (CCW) units include coil and piping insulation to protect against condensation in low-temperature extended (geothermal) range applications.

### *Figure 14: Coaxial heat exchanger*

# **CorMax® Connections**

Two CorMax valves are located inside the end access panel – one on the low side and one on the high side of the refrigeration circuit – for charging and servicing. All valves are 7/16" SAE fittings.

### *Figure 15: CorMax valves*

# **Air-to-Refrigerant Coil**

The air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. The fins are lanced and mechanically bonded to the tubes using finned edges on the inside which expand during assembly to enhance heat transfer capabilities. The maximum working pressure of the heat exchanger is 600 psig (4136 kPa). The coil is designed for optimal performance in both heating and cooling while maintaining the benefit of a compact size.

# **Refrigeration System**

Units have a coaxial heat exchanger with a copper inner tube and a steel outer tube. The air coil is a large face area coil with copper tubes and aluminum fins. Safety controls include high-pressure and low-temperature switch to lock out compressor operation at extreme conditions. For additional protection, units 015 and larger have a 7 psi (48 kPa) low-pressure switch to protect the compressor from low refrigerant charge. The low setting prevents nuisance trips while providing additional protection.

# **Blower Section**

The blower section includes the blower housing, wheel, motor and drain pan. It is separated from the compressor section by an insulated divider panel for maximum sound attenuation. The large size of the blower wheel allows it to rotate more slowly, reducing motor work to improve efficiency and provide for quiet operation. A large panel provides service access to the blower and motor. All blower/motor assemblies have a removable orifice ring on the housing to accommodate motor and blower removal without disconnecting the unit from the ductwork. For maximum flexibility, the fan discharge on the horizontal unit

can exit from the end or side of the unit. This can be configured at the factory or field-converted using interchangeable side and end panels. Refer to IM 1049.

11------------------------------------------------



# **Blower Motors**

The standard blower motor is a multi-speed, Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) type with thermal overload protection. It is permanently lubricated. The motor is factory wired to maximize performance and efficiency. Unit sizes 019 and larger have a terminal strip on the motor for simple motor speed change without going back to the control box. The motor is isolated from the fan housing using rubber isolators to minimize vibration transmission. All blower/motor assemblies have a removable orifice ring on the housing to accommodate motor and blower removal without disconnecting the unit from the ductwork.

### *Figure 16: High efficiency blower motor*

# **EC Constant CFM Fan Motor (Option)**

For unit sizes 015 – 070, the high efficiency EC constant airflow motor option provides constant airflow and economical performance over a wide static pressure range. This motor is an ideal option for high filtration applications that utilize the optional MERV-13 air filter. One of the many benefits of the EC motor is a soft start/stop feature for quiet operation. The 4-speed fan selector switch allows for quick fan speed adjustment to optimize unit performance. **NOTE:** These motors require a neutral wire for units with 460/3 electrical.

# **EC Constant Torque Fan Motor (Option)**

The optional constant torque EC blower motor offers increased efficiencies. This motor is similar in function to a PSC, but will deliver airflow at higher external static pressures. These motors are available for sizes 007 to 012 and include a field adjustable 4-position fan speed selector switch.

### *Table 1: Control options*

13------------------------------------------------



# **MicroTech® III Controller**

# **General Use and Information**

The MicroTech III Unit Controller is a microprocessor-based control board conveniently located in the unit control box for easy access through a removable access panel. The standalone unit controller is a hard wired interface and provides all the necessary field connections. The board can be wired for 24-volt AC output to the wall thermostat by using terminals R & C. An LED annunciator is located on the front corner of the unit chassis to quickly check the operating status of the unit.

# **Standard Sequence of Operation**

Assumes cycle fan operation-not continuous fan operation:

- **■ Cooling mode –** On a call for cooling, the compressor and fan will start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is energized, the reversing valve output will be de-energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off.
- **■ Heating mode –** On a call for heating, the compressor and fan start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is de-energized, the reversing valve output will be energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off. The reversing valve remains energized.

# **Available Operating Modes**

- **■ Unoccupied mode –** A simple "grounded" signal between terminals U and C (no power source required), puts the unit into the unoccupied mode for night setback operation.
- **■ Tenant override mode –** A switch on the deluxe automatic changeover thermostat can be activated during the unoccupied mode to put the unit back into the occupied mode for two hours for after-hours heating or cooling.

# **MicroTech III Unit Protections & LED Fault Status Annunciation**

- **■ Short cycle protection & random start –** After power cycle or deactivation of certain alarms, or when leaving the unoccupied mode, a new random compressor start-delay time between 300 and 360 seconds is generated. The random start timer prevents compressors in different units from starting simultaneously. Compressor minimum OFF 360 sec) and compressor minimum ON (180 sec) timers prevent compressor short cycling.
- **■ Motorized valve/pump restart –** The IV/PR (H8) terminals on the The MicroTech III unit controller are used to energize (open) a motorized valve or start a water pump to get water circulating prior to starting the compressor on call for heating or cooling. The IV/PR (H8) terminal may be "daisy chained" between 200 units.
- **■ Brownout protection –** The MicroTech III unit controller measures the input voltage and will suspend compressor and fan operation if the voltage falls below 80% of the unit nameplate rated value. An LED status is generated and an output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.
- **■ Emergency unit shutdown**  A simple grounded signal puts the unit into the shutdown mode. Remote shutdown is provided so that when properly connected to a water loop controller or remote switch, the emergency shutdown input can be used to shut down the water source heat pump. Compressor and fan operations are suspended, and an a unique two external LED status is generated.
- **■ Condensate overflow protection** The MicroTech III unit controller incorporates a liquid sensor at the top of the drain pan. Upon sensing water, cooling and dehumidification operations are suspended and an LED status is generated.
- **■ Remote reset of automatic lockouts –** The Remote Reset feature provides the means to remotely reset some lockouts generated by high-pressure and/or lowtemperature faults. When the MicroTech III unit controller is locked out due to one of these faults, and the cause of the fault condition has been cleared, energizing the O-terminal for 11 seconds or more forces the MicroTech III unit controller to clear the lockout. Cycling unit power also clears a lockout if the conditions causing the fault have been alleviated.
- **■ Intelligent alarm reset –** The Intelligent Reset helps to minimize nuisance trips of automatic lockouts caused by low-temperature faults in heating mode. This feature clears faults the first two times they occur within a 24-hour period and triggers an automatic lockout on the 3rd fault. The retry count is reset to zero every 24 hours.
- **■ Equipment protection control –** The MicroTech III unit controller receives separate input signals from the refrigerant high-pressure switch and the low suction line temperature sensor. In a high-pressure situation, compressor operation is suspended. In a low temperature situation during heating operation, the unit goes into a defrost cycle where the unit is put into cooling operation for 60 seconds until the coaxial heat exchanger is free of ice. Each switch generates its own unique LED status and output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat if either situation exists. Refer to "Table 2: MicroTech III controller configuration jumper settings" on page 15.

| Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up. Jumper JP3 is factory set for water freeze protection with the jumper open. Operation at fluid temperatures below 32°F with anti-freeze protection requires JP3 to be field configured for the jumper closed. If unit is employing a fresh water system (no anti-freeze protection), it is extremely important that JP3 jumper setting remains in the open position (factory default setting) in order to shut down the unit at the appropriate water temperature to protect your heat pump from freezing. Failure to do so can result in unit damage, property damage and will void unit warranty. | Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up.

# **Typical Horizontal Unit Installation**

# **Unit Location**

It is important to leave enough space for service personnel to perform maintenance or repair. Locate the horizontal unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access and do not install the unit above any piping. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out. Each unit is suspended from the ceiling by four 3/8" threaded rods fastened to the unit by a hanger bracket and rubber isolator. The design should place the unit directly below the structural members so that it is securely anchored.

Avoid installing units directly above spaces where building occupants will reside (e.g. above office desks or classrooms) to reduce the requirement for noise attenuation. Do not place units above high traffic areas because service access may be limited during occupied hours. For example, units are typically installed above the hallway drop ceiling in Schools and the supply and return air is routed directly into classrooms. Local code may require fire dampers to be used with this application.

# **Piping**

The WSHP unit is typically connected to the supply/return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a

*Figure 17: Typical ceiling installation*

sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydraulic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

# **Condensate Drain Piping**

CCH-CCW horizontal units have a 3/4-inch FPT condensate drain connection, flush to the unit. The field installed condensate piping must include a trap after the connection and be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

18------------------------------------------------



# **Ductwork & Sound Attenuation**

Ductwork is normally applied to ceiling-mounted heat pumps on the discharge side of the unit. A discharge collar is provided on all horizontal unit models for fastening the ductwork. Use a flexible connector between the discharge collar and the duct transformation to help reduce vibration transmission from the cabinet and to simplify disconnection of the unit from the ceiling ductwork. If return ductwork is to be used, attach a flexible connector to the filter rack collar to help reduce vibration transmission and removal of the unit. Return plenum ducting should be at least 12 inches away from the coil so that the coil is evenly loaded with return air.

As a general recommendation, duct interiors should have an acoustic / thermal lining at least 1/2 inch thick over the entire duct run. For better sound attenuation, line the last five diameters of duct before each register with a one-inch thick sound blanket. Elbows, tees and dampers can create turbulence or distortion in the airflow. Place a straight length of duct, 5 to 10 times the duct width, before the next fitting to smooth out airflow. Diffusers that are located in the bottom of a trunk duct can also produce noise. For this same reason, volume control dampers should be located several duct widths upstream from an air outlet.

For Hotel, Motel, Dormitory or Nursing Home applications that use a single duct discharge, a velocity of 500 to 600 fpm is suggested. These applications typically have static pressures as low as 0.05 inches of water and duct lengths approximately six feet in length. The discharge duct must be fully lined and have a square elbow without turning vanes. Return air for these applications should enter through a "low" sidewall filter grille and route up the stud space to a ceiling plenum. For horizontal heat pumps mounted from the ceiling, an insulated return plenum is sometimes placed at the return air opening to further attenuate line-of-sight sound transmission through return openings.

# **Typical Cooling and Heating Refrigeration Cycles**

**Note:** For standard heat pump operation only

# **Cooling Refrigeration Cycle**

When the wall thermostat calls for COOLING, the reversing valve directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger. There, the heat is removed by the water, and the hot gas condenses to become a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil. The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the air passing over the surfaces of the coil. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

# **Heating Refrigeration Cycle**

When the wall thermostat calls for HEATING, the reversing valve directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the air-torefrigerant heat exchanger coil. There, the heat is removed by the air passing over the surfaces of the coil and the hot gas condenses and becomes a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the waterto-refrigerant heat exchanger. The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the water. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

20------------------------------------------------



# **Systems**

Water source heat pump systems are one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly systems available for heating and cooling buildings. High-efficiency, self contained units (sizes 7,000 Btuh to 290,000 Btuh) can be placed in virtually any location within a building. Each unit responds only to the heating or cooling load of the individual zone it serves. This permits an excellent comfort level for occupants, better control of energy use for building owners and lower seasonal operating costs. The Air-Conditioning Refrigeration Institute (ARI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) publish standards so that water source heat pumps are rated for specific applications. The ARI/ISO loop options shown in this catalog are typical water source heat pump loop choices available in today's market. These systems offer benefits ranging from low cost installation to the highest energy efficiency available in the market today.

# **Boiler / Tower Applications**

# **AHRI ISO 13256-1**

A "Boiler/Tower" application uses a simple two-pipe water circulating system that adds heat, removes heat or transfers rejected heat to other units throughout the building. The water temperature for heating is generally maintained between 65ºF – 70ºF and is usually provided by a natural gas or electric boiler located in a mechanical room. The condensing water temperature, during cooling months, is maintained between 85ºF and 95ºF and requires the use of a cooling tower to dissipate waste heat. Cooling towers can be located on the roof, or inside or adjacent to the building. This application can be the lowest cost of the loop options available.

Note: ASHRAE 90.1 standards require that circulating pumps over 10 HP will require use of "variable frequency drive" equipment and pipe insulation to be used whenever water temperatures are below 60 degrees and above 105 degrees. See ASHRAE 90.1 Standards for details.

### *Figure 21: Boiler/tower application*

# **Open Loop Well Water Applications**

# **AHRI ISO 13256-1**

"Open Loop" well water systems use ground water to remove or add heat to the interior water loop. The key benefit of an open loop system is the constant water temperature, usually 50ºF to 60ºF, which provides efficient operation at a low first cost. Most commercial designers incorporate a heat exchanger to isolate the building loop from the well water. Using heat exchangers can reduce maintenance issues while still allowing the transfer of heat from unit to unit as with the "Boiler/Tower System". A successful design provides an ample amount of groundwater (approximately 2 GPM per ton) and adequate provisions for discharging water back to the aquifer or surface. Open Loop applications are commonly used in coastal areas where soil characteristics allow reinjection wells to return the water back to the aquifer. Note that some states have requirements on the depths of return water reinjection wells, and such wells must be approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Also, bad water quality can increase problems with heat exchanger scaling. Suspended solids can erode the heat exchanger. Strainers can be used to contain suspended solids.

### *Figure 22: Open loop well application*

21------------------------------------------------



# **Closed Loop Geothermal Range Applications**

# **AHRI ISO 13256-1**

"Vertical Closed Loop" applications are installed by drilling vertical bore holes into the earth and inserting a plastic polyethylene supply/return pipe into the holes. The vertical wells are connected in parallel reverse return fashion to allow the water from the building to circulate evenly throughout the borefield. The circulating fluid dissipates heat to the ground in a similar manner as a "tower" and adds heat back to the loop like a boiler. If properly designed, the loop field can maintain the loop temperatures necessary to condition the building without the use of a boiler or a tower. Loop temperatures usually range from 37ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern applications can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. The number of bore holes and their depth should be determined by using commercial software that is specifically designed for vertical geothermal range applications. Typical bore depths of a vertical loop range from 150 to 400 feet and generally require about 250 feet of surface area per ton of cooling.

### *Figure 23: Vertical loop application*

A closed loop "Horizontal" geothermal range application is similar to a vertical loop application with the exception that the loops are installed in trenches approximately 5 feet below the ground surface. The piping may be installed using a "four-pipe" or "six-pipe" design and could require 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of surface area per ton of cooling. Loop temperatures for a commercial application can range from 35ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern climates can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. Horizontal loops are generally not applied in urban areas because land use and costs can be prohibitive. New advances in installation procedures have improved the assembly time of horizontal loops while keeping the first cost lower than a vertical loop.

*Figure 24: Horizontal loop application*

A "Surface Water" or "Lake" closed loop system is an geothermal range loop that is directly installed in a lake or body of water that is near the building. In many cases, the body of water is constructed on the building site to meet drainage or aesthetic requirements. Surface loops use bundled polyethylene coils that are connected in the same manner as a vertical or horizontal loop using a parallel reverse return design. The size and the depth of the lake is critical. Commercial design services should be used to certify that a given body of water is sufficient to withstand the building loads. Loop temperatures usually range from 35ºF to 90ºF and prove to be the best cooling performer and lowest cost loop option of the three geothermal loops. Some applications may not be good candidates due to public access or debris problems from flooding.

# **Selection Procedure**

Achieving optimal performance with water source heat pump systems requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Use a building load program to determine the heating and cooling loads of each zone prior to making equipment selections. With this information, the Daikin SelectTools™ software selection program for Water Source Heat Pumps can be used to provide fast, accurate and complete selections of all Daikin water source heat pump products. SelectTools software is available by contacting your local Daikin Representative.

While we recommend that you use Daikin SelectTools software for all unit selections, manual selections can be accomplished using the same zone load information and the capacity tables available in this catalog.

# **Boiler / Tower Application Manual Selections**

The following example illustrates a typical selection for a zone in a boiler/tower system for a commercial building.

A building load program determines that this zone needs 38,255 Btuh of total cooling, 31,832 Btuh of sensible cooling and 36,988 Btuh of total heating. The water temperatures for the boiler/tower system are 90°F for cooling and 70°F for heating. The return air temperature is 80ºF dry bulb with 67°F wet bulb for cooling and 70°F for heating.

# **Zone Requirements:**


Since a Daikin Model CCH 036 produces approximately 36,000 Btuh of cooling, it is not sufficient for this zone and a model CCH 042 should be considered. Model CCH is chosen because it is specifically designed for a boiler/ tower application. Typical water flow rates for boiler/tower applications are 2.0 to 2.5 GPM per ton and in this example no antifreeze is used.

### **Selection:**


# **Geothermal Range Applications**

The following example illustrates the same zone in a geothermal range application.

The load requirements for the zone are the same as the previous example – 38,255 Btuh of total cooling and 31,832 Btuh of sensible cooling and 36,988 Btuh of heating. Geothermal loop software programs are available to help determine the size of the loop field based on:

- **■** Specific acreage available for the loop which produces specific min/max loop temps for the unit selection. Entering water temperatures for geothermal range systems can be as high as 90º to 100ºF and as low as 30ºF based on the geographical location of the building. Water flow rates are

typically 2.5 to 3 GPM per ton and the use of antifreeze is required in most northern applications.

# **Fan Performance**

### *Table 9: Standard PSC motor*


**Note:** PSC blower motors are designed to deliver nominal 400 cfm/ton.

### *Table 10: Low static PSC motor*


**Note:** For wet coil, calculate face velocity (cfm/ coil face area, sq. ft.). Add the following static to the external static pressure for the corresponding face velocity: 300 fpm = 0.05", 400 fpm = 0.10", 500 fpm = 0.14". Re-enter table at the increased external static pressure to determine final cfm. = Out of Range

# **Fan Performance (Continued)**

### *Table 11: Constant torque motor CFM values - Sizes 007–012*


**Notes:** 1. For wet coil, calculate face velocity (cfm/coil face area, sq. ft.). Add the following static to the external static pressure for the corresponding face velocity: 300 fmp = 0.05", 400 fpm = 0.10", 500 fpm = 0.14". Re-enter table at the increased external static pressure to determine final cfm.

2. Actual unit performance may differ from those listed in the catalog and selection software due to variations in field conditions, unit installations, and test and balancing devices

# **Electrical Data (continued)**

### *Table 14: Low static motor electrical data*


### *Table 15: EC motor*


**Note:** \*All 460-60-3 units require 4-wire power, which includes a neutral wire. EC motors 460-60-3 volt units require a 265 volt power supply. Both a hot AND a neutral wire are required to obtain proper fan motor voltage. Therefore, 4- wires with a wye type wiring arrangement is required.

# **Operating Limits**

# **Information for Initial Start-Up Only**

# **Standard Range Units:**

Units are designed to start in an ambient of 50ºF (10ºC), with entering air at 50ºF (10ºC), with entering water at 70ºF (21ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

**Note:** *This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

# **Extended (Geothermal) Range Units:**

Extended (geothermal) range heat pump conditioners are designed to start in an ambient of 40ºF (5ºC), with entering air at 40ºF (5ºC), with entering water at 40ºF (5ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

**Note:** *This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*


### *Table 16: Water source heat pump operating temperature limits (for continuous duty)*

**Notes:**1. In the heating mode, the sum of the entering air + entering water must be ≥ 100°F.

2. MINIMUM WATER FLOW = 1.5 GPM/Ton.

3. Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Geothermal range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.


### *Table 17: Water source heat pump operating temperature limits at start-up (not for continuous duty)*

# **Environment**

This equipment is designed for indoor installation only. Sheltered locations such as attics, garages, etc., generally will not provide sufficient protection against extremes in temperature and/or humidity, and equipment performance, reliability, and service life may be adversely affected.

# **Power Supply**

A voltage variation of +/-10% of nameplate voltage is acceptable. Three-phase system imbalance shall not exceed 2%.

# **Combination Balancing and Shutoff (Ball) Valves**

Constructed of brass and rated at 400 psig (2758 kPa) maximum working pressure. Valves have a built-in adjustable memory stop to eliminate rebalancing. Valves have FPT connections on both ends for connection to the water hose and to the field piping.

*Figure 26: Shut off ball valve*

# **Motorized Valve**

Used for variable pumping applications, the valve is wired directly to the H8 terminal on the MicroTech III controller and typically piped in the return water line from the unit. The valve will allow water flow only when there is a call for heating or cooling. The valve is rated for 300 psig (2070 kPa).

### *Figure 27: 2-way motorized valve*

# **Supply and Return Water Hoses**

*Figure 28: Flow control, supply and return water hoses*

Hose kits with standard flexible supply and return hoses are recommended between the water source heat pump unit and building's hard piping system. This is to control possible noise and transmission of vibration from the unit in the space.

Standard supply and return fire-rated hoses have Thermoplastic Rubber (EPTF) with braided covering of stainless steel. The supply and return hoses have a swivel fitting at one end to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Fittings are either plated steel or brass. The maximum working pressure for both the shut-off ball valve and shut-off ball valve with strainer is 400 psig. The maximum operating temperature is -4°F (-20°C) to 250°F (121°C).

A summary of various hose kits are listed below. See Catalog 1196 for more detailed hose kit features.

**Hose kit # 1:** Condensate hose kits – one flexible fire rated condensate hose with fixed male NPT x female JIC swivel with male NPT adapter.

### *Figure 29: Condensate hose kit*

**Hose kit # 2:** Supply and return hose kits – Two flexible supply and return hoses with fixed male NPT x female JIC swivel with male NPT adapter.

**Hose kit # 4:** Supply and return hose kit with shut-off ball valves - valves have pressure and temperature (P/T) ports to allow pressure and temperature readings during commissioning.

**Hose kit # 5:** Supply and return hose kit with shut-off ball valves, y-strainer and blowdown valve – The supply hose assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with one pressure/temperature test port, y-strainer with blowdown valve. The return assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with pressure/temperature test port and drain valve for servicing.

**Hose kit # 6:** Supply and return hose kit with ball valve and auto flow control valve – The supply hose assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with one pressure/ temperature test port. The return assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with two pressure/temperature test ports and auto flow control valve.

**Hose kit # 7:** Supply and return hose kit with ball valve and auto flow control valve, y-strainer and blowdown valve – The supply hose assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with one pressure/temperature test port y-strainer with blowdown valve. The return assembly includes a shut-off ball valve with two pressure/temperature test ports and auto flow control valve.

# **Two or Four-Inch Filter Rack (Option)**

Selectable as factory-mounted or as an optional fieldinstalled kit, replacing the standard 1" filter rack. It provides a 1" (25 mm) extended collar for connection of return air ductwork and accepts a 2" (51 mm) or 4" thick, high performance filter. The filter rack can be mounted for left hand or right hand filter removal by rotating it 180 degrees. Two thumb screws allow easy removal of the access door for quick filter changes without using a tool. See page 41 for details.
