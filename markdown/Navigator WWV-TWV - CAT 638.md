### Environmentally Friendly

As we become more aware of the environmental impact of their energy consumption and look for ways to reduce carbon footprint, the demand for electric HVAC systems has grown. With the ability for heating water, the Navigator's TWV Templifier® eliminates the need for fossil fuel-powered boilers, making it an attractive option for building owners and facility managers seeking to reduce carbonization. Coupled with performance levels that can be up to three times more energy-efficient than traditional electric resistance water heaters and gas-fired boilers, this translates into lower energy consumption, reduced operating costs and a smaller environmental footprint.

OVERVIEW


### Industry-Leading Performance Sustainable Heat Pump Technology

In the evolving energy landscape shaped by electrification, heat pump technology takes center stage as a compelling solution for a cleaner and more sustainable future. The Navigator's optional TWV Templifier® configuration, operates with up to 140**˚**F leaving condenser water, utilizing the advantages of heat pump technology.

This sustainable and efficient solution for hot water heating aligns with global electrification trends, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. By utilizing electricity as the primary energy source, heat pump technology eliminates direct fossil fuel consumption, contributing to decarbonization efforts. Operating at lower temperatures than conventional systems, heat pumps conserve energy and lower operational costs. Additionally, heat pumps seamlessly integrate with renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, further enhancing their benefits for environmental sustainability.

### Low GWP Refrigerant

WWV chillers are designed around R-513A, a next-generation refrigerant with an ultra-low GWP of 1 and an A1 safety group classification. This combination results in the lowest possible flammability and toxicity scores, making R513A a truly sustainable solution. This refrigerant translates into a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, actively contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

Building owners who are committed to sustainability often pursue Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Certification. Enhanced Refrigerant Management (formerly EA Credit 4) qualification is partially determined by tonnage and refrigerant quantity, and WWV chillers meet these requirements, making them eligible for LEED certification.

### VVR COMPRESSION

Leveraging the innovative technology found across Daikin's chiller portfolio, Navigator's performance is optimized for every condition and at every hour of the day with Variable Volume Ratio (VVR®) technology and patented high-efficiency oil separation. VVR compression technology senses the precise amount of lift needed and adjusts the compression ratio on the fly to deliver optimal efficiency, regardless of ambient temperature or time of day. This gives you the power of efficiencies that in many cases meet or exceed ASHRAE 90.1 – 2016 levels. While performance is matched in real-time as conditions vary, built-in and patented compressor mechanics reduce noise and vibration resulting in indoor-friendly sound levels at all load points.

### Integrated Variable Frequency Drive

Navigator introduces a breakthrough in performance with a single VFD-driven compressor, ideal for applications unsuited to traditional centrifugals or magnetic bearing solutions. The innovative single rotor design ensures quiet operation across all load conditions, providing a versatile solution for diverse environments. The VFD dynamically adjusts compressor speed in direct response to varying loads and evaporator/condenser pressures.

# ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

# IDEAL FOR MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING HOSPITALS OR DATA CENTERS

### Maximum Uptime

A power loss could turn into a critical loss of cooling in mission critical facilities such as data centers, health care buildings, or manufacturing processes. A short-term power loss can occur during power interruptions, brown-outs or utility switching operations.

# **RAPIDRESTORE® AND FAST-LOADING**

The Navigator chiller is available with a RapidRestore® option that allows it to start as fast as 35 seconds after power is restored. Once power has been restored and the chiller is back online, the next critical step is reaching 100% cooling capacity as fast as possible. That's when the Fast-Loading ability of a Navigator chiller with RapidRestore proves its worth. With Fast-Loading, the Navigator chiller can reach 100% cooling capacity in less than 160 seconds. Comparable water-cooled chillers need up to 10 minutes.

### EQUIPMENT FOR PLANNED SITUATIONS

Forming a contingency plan in the event of an outage can help you quickly get operations back to normal and limit financial loss, and help you breathe easier when the unexpected happens. Selecting the right-sized equipment is just one part of the process. The best contingency plans start by assessing and understanding your financial risk, and then using this information to drive the rest of your plan. Our Rental Solutions experts can specify the supplemental cooling system required to support any situation you're experiencing.

- **• System maintenance**
- **• Building expansion**
- **• Server room heat generation**
- **• Seasonal/staff heat load swings**
- **• Contingency plans**

### STANDBY

Standby for critical applications and processes is another efficient use for temporary rental equipment. A temporary system is sometimes used to back up manufacturing and chemical processes, or when a hospital's required system redundancy has been reduced.

### SUPPLEMENTAL CAPACITY

When the demand of your facility or process exceeds your current system's capacity because of record-high temperatures or changes to cooling requirements, Daikin temporary rentals can be used to increase your heating or cooling output. By eliminating the need to purchase additional equipment that might be only used part of the year, you save on capital expenditures.
