<span id="page-5-0"></span>### **GentleFlo Delivery**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators are engineered and manufactured to deliver quiet, continuous comfort. We developed our GentleFlo™ air moving system to minimize operating sound levels – even as demands for more fresh air require units to operate longer and work harder. GentleFlo features include:

- Fan wheels are large, wide and rotate at a low speed to reduce fan sound levels. They are impactresistant and carefully balanced to provide consistent performance.
- Offset, aerodynamic fan wheel blades move air efficiently ([Figure 1](#page-5-1)).
- Precision tolerances help reduce flow and pressure turbulence, resulting in lower sound levels.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>*Figure 1: GentleFlo Fan Technology*

- Fan housings incorporate the latest logarithmicexpansion technology for smoother, quieter air flow [\(Figure 2](#page-5-2)).
- A large, expanded discharge opening minimizes air resistance, further lowering sound levels.
- Modular fan construction contributes to equal outlet velocities and promotes quiet operation.
- Fan shafts are of ground and polished steel to minimize deflections and provide consistent, longterm operation.
- Fan assemblies are balanced before unit assembly, then tested after assembly (and rebalanced if necessary) to provide stable, quiet operation.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**The Right Amount of Fresh Air and Cooling**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators deliver required amounts of fresh air to meet ventilation requirements and added cooling capacity to maintain consistent comfort for students and teachers. Our Economizer Operation, Demand Control Ventilation (DCV) and Part Load, Variable Air options allow you to match classroom comfort requirements even more closely, and reduce operating costs.

This means that you can be confident that your school is meeting ventilation standards for Indoor Air Quality and that your students are receiving adequate air to be attentive to instruction. At the same time, you are saving money in early morning hours, between classes or after hours when classrooms are heated and cooled but not always fully occupied.

### **Economizer Operation**

It is well recognized that cooling, not heating, is the main thermal challenge in school classrooms. The typical classroom is cooled by outdoor air over half the time, even in cold climates. It is therefore essential that unit ventilators efficiently deliver outdoor air when classroom conditions call for "free" or economizer cooling.

With Daikin Applied unit ventilators, you can have outdoor air whenever it is needed. Economizer operation is facilitated by the outdoor air damper, which automatically adjusts the above-minimum outside air position to provide free cooling when the outdoor air temperature is appropriate [\(Figure 3](#page-6-1)). On units equipped with MicroTech control, three levels of economizer control are available.

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>*Figure 3: Full Economizer Mode*

### **Part-Load Variable Air Control**

Part Load Variable Air control can be used to automatically adjust the unit ventilator fan speed based upon the room load and the room temperature. This MicroTech control option provides higher latent cooling capabilities and quieter operation during non-peak load periods by basing indoor fan speed upon room load.

Lower fan speeds in conjunction with our GentleFlo fan technology contributes to a very quiet classroom environment.

Room-temperature PI control loops determine the speed of the fan, which varies according to the room load. It also provides a built-in delay to prevent overshooting for better comfort control. The outdoor air damper's minimum-air position is adjusted with the fan speed to bring in a constant amount of fresh air.

### **Demand Control Ventilation**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators can be equipped to use input from a CO2 controller to ventilate the space based on actual occupancy instead of a fixed design occupancy. This Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV) system monitors the amount of CO2 so enough fresh outdoor air is introduced to maintain good air quality. The system is designed to achieve a target ventilation rate (e.g., 15 CFM/person) based on actual occupancy.

By using DCV to monitor the actual occupancy pattern in a room, the system can allow code-specific levels of outdoor air to be delivered when needed. Unnecessary over-ventilation is avoided during periods of low or intermittent occupancy, leading to improved energy efficiencies and cost savings.

# **Precise Temperature and Dehumidification Control**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators provide precise temperature and dehumidification control to keep students and teachers comfortable while making maximum use of "free" outdoor-air cooling to reduce operating costs. They utilize a draw-thru fan design that contributes to even heat transfer and provides uniform discharge air temperatures into the classroom. MicroTech control strategies and 2-stage compressor operation provide precise control of temperature and humidity levels under both part-load and full-load conditions.

7------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Draw-Thru Design For Even Discharge Temperatures**

The Daikin Applied Draw-Thru design sets our unit ventilators apart from most competitive models. With this system, fans draw air through the entire heat transfer element ([Figure 4\)](#page-7-1) rather than blowing it through highly concentrated areas of the coil element. The result is more uniform discharge air temperatures into the classroom and more efficient unit ventilator operation.

#### <span id="page-7-1"></span>*Figure 4: Draw-Thru Design Provides Even Discharge Air*

*Figure 5: Draw-Thru Vs. Blow-Thru Design*

# **Low Installation Costs**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators have many features that make them economical to purchase and to install in both new construction and retrofit applications. It is this attention to detail and understanding of school applications that make them the system of choice.

### **Perfect For Both New Construction & Retrofit Applications**

New construction installations are easily accomplished with the Daikin Applied AEQ size 024 air source heat pump unit ventilator because of the avoided added cost and space required for expensive duct work. This is important in existing buildings and also in new construction where floor-to-floor heights can be reduced, saving on overall building costs. Further savings can be realized because air source heat pump self-contained unit installations use less space than units that require water supply and return piping.

Retrofit installations are economical because new units typically fit the same space occupied by existing ones.

### **Controls Flexibility**

Multiple control options—including MicroTech controls with our Protocol Selectability feature—provide easy, low cost integration of Daikin Applied unit ventilators into the building automation system of your choice (See ["Micro-](#page-64-1)[Tech Controls" on page 65](#page-64-1)).

MicroTech controls come with on-board BACnet MS/ TP communications, or with optional LonTalk, to communicate control and monitoring information to your BAS, without the need for costly gateways.

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Low Operating Costs**

Schools consume more than 10% of the total energy expended in the United States for comfort heating and cooling of buildings. As energy costs increase, educators are placed in a difficult position: caught between rising costs, lower budgets and the requirements to raise educational standards.

Fortunately, the technology and the system exists for schools to take control of their energy expenditures while providing a comfortable environment for learning. And that system is the Daikin Applied unit ventilator.

Consider these realities of school environments:

- Most heating energy in schools is expended to heat unoccupied spaces. Because lights, computers and students give off considerable heat, occupied spaces require little supplemental heat.
- The removal of heat is usually required in occupied classrooms, even when outside temperatures are moderately cold (i.e., 35 to 40°F).
- Then consider how Daikin Applied unit ventilators, located in each classroom, take advantage of these realities to lower operating costs:
- They provide individual classroom control and comfort.
- They can be cycled on when the room is occupied and cycled off when it is not.
- They bring in fresh air from directly outside the classroom for high indoor air quality.
- During most of the school year, they use outdoor air to keep classrooms comfortable without the expense of mechanical cooling.

### **MicroTech® Control Options Further Reduce Operating Costs**

Many of the MicroTech control options available with Daikin Applied unit ventilators can further reduce operating costs. For example:

- **• Economizer Operation:** Economizer operation automatically adjusts the above-minimum outside air position to provide free cooling when the outdoor air temperature is appropriate.
- **• Demand Control Ventilation:** By using CO2 levels to monitor the actual occupancy pattern in a room, the system can allow code-specific levels of outdoor air to be delivered when needed without costly over-ventilation during periods of low or intermittent occupancy ([Figure 6\)](#page-8-1).

<span id="page-8-1"></span>*Figure 6: Energy Savings with Demand Control Ventilation*

**• Occupancy Mode Operation:** Units can be programmed to operate only sparingly during unoccupied periods and at night to conserve energy.

### **Two-Stage Compressor**

Air conditioning units are usually sized for worse case conditions. During high load requirement the unit will operate in high fan speed and high compressor capacity. Most of the time there is not a full load on the compressor. Operation in lower load will be at medium or low fan speeds which will be at the lower displacement compressor stage. The two-stage compressor will remain at low speed until more cooling is required. With the two-stage compressor, the unit will run on lower fan speeds most of the time improving comfort through better humidity control and quieter operation, while minimizing issues with over-sizing.

Other units utilizing single stage compressors operate at full compressor capacity all of the time regardless of fan speed.

9------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**Easy To Maintain**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators are designed to provide easy access for maintenance and service personnel to all serviceable components. Most maintenance tasks are easily handled by a single person.

### **Modular Fan Deck**

The entire fan deck is easily removed as a single unit. This provides ready access to fan wheels, motors, bearings and other components for service, cleaning or repair.

The fan deck's rotating element has one large, selfaligning end bearing and a permanently lubricated motor bearing for smooth operation. On most sizes the location of the fan shaft bearing is at the end of the shaft (out of the air stream). This enables easy access for oiling on units built with an oilable end bearing (some units built with permanently sealed end bearings).

#### *Figure 7: Long-Life Bearings*

**Permanently Lubricated Self-Aligning, Oilable Motor Bearing End Bearing**

### **Heavy-Duty Discharge Grille**

The discharge grille on the top of the unit is made from extra-strength steel bar stock, promoting long life [\(Figure](#page-9-1)  [8\)](#page-9-1). It can be removed to facilitate cleaning of fans and fan housings. A built-in 10-degree angle provides proper air throw to blanket the room for proper air circulation and comfort.

<span id="page-9-1"></span>### **Easy Motor Removal**

Unlike with many competitive models, the motor in Daikin Applied unit ventilators is separate from the fan assembly and is located out of the airstream at the end of the fan shaft—away from the hot coil—for easier maintenance and removal. Locating the motor away from the coil [\(Figure 9\)](#page-9-2) has the added benefit of extending motor life. Our directcoupled motor and self-aligning motor mount facilitate motor change-out. The motor comes with a molex plug that fits all sizes and further simplifies removal.

<span id="page-9-2"></span>#### *Figure 9: Modular Design*

10------------------------------------------------



### **Tamper-Resistant Fasteners**

Front panels and top access doors are held in place by tamper-resistant, positive-positioning fasteners. They are quickly removed or opened with the proper tool, but deter unauthorized access to the unit's interior (See [Figure 11](#page-10-0)).

### **Sectionalized Access Panels and Doors**

All units have three separate front panels and hinged top access doors, sized for convenient handling by a single person (See [Figure 11](#page-10-0)). The result is easy, targeted access to the component that needs servicing:

- Two end panels provide easy access to piping, temperature control components and the fan switch. Unlike units with full-length front panels, these can be removed without disturbing the normal operation of the unit.
- Hinged top access doors provide easy access into the end compartments to facilitate convenient servicing of the motor, electrical, and refrigeration components.
- Center front panel provides easy access to the filter and the fan shaft bearing on unit sizes 044 and 054.

### **Filter**

Three filter types are offered:

- Units come standard with a single-use filter which is designed to be used once and discarded.
- Optional, permanent metal filters are available and can be removed for cleaning and reused numerous times.
- Renewable media filters, which consist of a heavyduty, painted-metal structural frame and renewable media.

#### *Figure 10: Easy Access to Filter*

<span id="page-10-0"></span>*Figure 11: Easy Access with Tamper-Resistant Fasteners*

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**Built To Last**

Our industrial-strength design provides the durability to withstand the rigors of the classroom environment. Its solid construction and rugged finish promotes continued alignment, structural strength and long-lasting beauty decades after the unit is installed. In fact, many units installed over 30 years ago continue to provide quiet, reliable classroom comfort.

### **Heavy Duty Frame Construction**

Daikin Applied's exclusive, unitized frame ([Figure 12](#page-11-1)) is far superior to the fastener-type construction used by other manufacturers. Loosened fasteners can cause vibration, rattles and sagging panels. With unitized construction, there are no fasteners (screws or bolts) to come loose.

Other design features that promote trouble-free operation and long life include:

- A corrosion-resistant, galvanized-steel frame.
- Extra-strength, steel-bar discharge grille.
- Heavy-gauge-metal cabinet access panels and doors.
- An extra-strength pipe tunnel that stiffens the structure while adding aerodynamic air flow within the unit.
- Hidden reinforcement that provides additional built-in support for the top section as well as better support for the fan deck assembly.
- A rigid exterior that is strong enough to support maintenance personnel without fear of damaging the unit.

### **Rugged Exterior Finish**

The superior finish of the unit ventilator's cabinets fosters long-lasting beauty as well as resistance to abuse and corrosion. We apply the very highest standards at every step of the finishing process to provide lasting quality:

- High-quality furniture steel is carefully inspected before painting. Scratches and marks that might show through are removed.
- After fabrication, the metal undergoes a five-stage cleaning and phosphatizing process to provide a good bonding surface and reduce the possibility of peeling or corrosion.
- A specially formulated, environmentally friendly, thermosetting urethane powder is applied electrostatically to the exterior panels. This film is oven-cured to provide correct chemical cross-linking and to obtain maximum scuff- and mar-resistance.
- The top of the unit is finished with a textured, non-glare and scuff-resistant, charcoal bronze electrostatic paint. End and front panels are available in a pleasing array of architectural colors.
- The Oxford brown steel kickplate is coated and baked with a thermosetting urethane powder paint to blend with floor moldings and provide years of trouble-free service.
- Each unit is painstakingly inspected before boxing, then encapsulated in a clear plastic bag, surrounded by an extra-heavy-duty cardboard box and secured to a skid to help provide damage-free shipment.

### **Durable, Energy Efficient Fan Motors**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators are equipped with 115/60/1 NEMA motors that feature low operating current and wattage ([Figure 13\)](#page-12-0).

#### <span id="page-12-0"></span>*Figure 13: Energy-Efficient Fan Motor*

Additional features of these motors include:

- Split-capacitor (PSC) design with automatic reset and thermal-overload protection.
- No brushes, contacts or centrifugal starting switches the most common causes of motor failure.
- A built-in, decoupled isolation system to reduce transmission of vibrations for quieter operation.
- A multi-tap, auto-transformer ([Figure 14](#page-12-1)) provides multiple fan motor speed control through the speed switch. The motor is independent of supply voltage, which allows stocking of one motor (school districtwide) for various voltage applications.

#### *Figure 14: Multi-Tap Auto-Transformer*

<span id="page-12-1"></span>### **Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM)**

The EC motor with almost no draw down of the unit's airflow (cfm) as static pressures increase. As a result, there is little need to oversize the unit to provide full air volume at high static pressures.

- Self adjusting for constant torque for part load efficiency.
- Available with 3-speed or variable airflow operation

### **Durable Damper Design**

All dampers in Daikin Applied unit ventilators use the turned-metal principle on their long closing edges [\(Figure 15\)](#page-12-2). Positive sealing is provided by embedding the edge into wool mohair (no metal to metal contact). There are no plastic gaskets to become brittle with time, sag with heat or age, or require a difficult slot fit to seal. Nylon damper bearings foster quiet, maintenance-free operation.

#### *Additional features include:*

• Outdoor air dampers are made of galvanized steel to inhibit corrosion, with double-wall welded construction for rigidity and encapsulated insulation [\(Figure 15](#page-12-2)).

• Room air dampers are free-floating and designed to prevent intermittent gusts of cold air from blowing directly into the classroom on windy days [\(Figure 16\)](#page-12-3). They are constructed of aluminum with built-in rigidity. The metal forming technique that is employed resists twisting and incorporates a full-length counter weight for easy rotation. The simple principle of an area exposed to a force is used to automatically close the damper, rather than open it, when gusts of cold air occur.

<span id="page-14-0"></span># **AEQ – Air Source Heat Pump**

Model type AEQ units include a heat pump refrigeration circuit and supplemental electric heat. The full airflow is directed across the coils at all times. The refrigeration circuit is used as the primary source for cooling and heating. The electric heaters can be used to supplement the refrigeration heating output or provide all heat if compressor operation is not available. If the unit is equipped with a factory mounted humidity sensor or field connected humidistat the electric heat may also be used for reheat in a dehumidification mode.

- For network control applications, our Protocol Selectability feature provides easy, low-cost integration of Daikin Applied unit ventilators into most building automation systems.
- Flexible BAS network communication options guard against controls obsolescence, keeping MicroTech controls viable for the life of your Daikin Applied equipment.

### **Three Control Levels**

MicroTech controllers provide the flexibility to operate Daikin Applied unit ventilators on any of three levels:

- As stand-alone units, with control either at the unit or from a wall sensor.
- Controlled as part of a network using a centralized building automation system.
- In a-client-server relationship, where client units follow the server unit for some or all functions.

# **Stand-Alone Control**

When operating in stand-alone mode, the MicroTech controller performs complete room temperature and ventilation control. Units can be operated in occupied, unoccupied, stand-by, or bypass (tenant override) modes. Occupied/unoccupied changeover can be accomplished:

• Automatically by an internal Daily Schedule (two occupied times and two unoccupied times for each of the seven days, and one holiday schedule)

• Using a field-wired occupancy sensor.

If a school has more than one zone, separate, internallyprogrammed schedules are used to regulate each zone.

### **Client-Server Control**

Designate the server and client units and we will factory configure and install the controllers so they are set up for a local peer-to-peer network between units (leaving only the network wiring between these units to be field installed).

Client units can be field-configured to be dependent or independent as follows:

- Dependent client units follow the server unit completely. They are ideal for large spaces that have even loads across the space (such as some libraries).
- Independent client units (default) use server setpoints and client sensors. The client follows the server unit modes, such as heat or cool, but has the flexibility to provide the conditioning required for its area within the space. Independent client units perform better in spaces where loads vary from one area of the space to the other (such as stairwells or cafeterias).

### **Network Control**

MicroTech unit controllers provide easy integration into your building automation system of choice. All factoryinstalled options are handled by the unit controller. This simplifies the transmission of monitoring and setpoint data to the building automation system.

MicroTech controls have on-board BACnet communication, with optional LonTalk, to communicate control and monitoring information to your BAS, without the need for costly gateways (see ["Communication](#page-67-1)  [Types" on page 68\)](#page-67-1).

Flexible network communication options via our Protocol Selectability feature help you avoid control obsolescence over the life of your Daikin Applied equipment.

### **USB Interface**

An optional USB-A port can be factory-configured. This option simplifies field access to the MicroTech controller. The USB interface can be used for downloading code, changing unit configuration, accessing external memory, or a field-connection to run the service tool. Technicians will have access to read all inputs, download code, setup/download trend data, and backup, restore, or change unit configuration.

### **SD Card**

An optional SD card can be factory configured. The SD card allows storage of data trending and configuration parameters. For further details see [page 72.](#page-71-0)

16------------------------------------------------



### **Economizer Modes**

Economizer operation is facilitated by the outdoor air damper, which automatically adjusts the above-minimum outside air position to provide free cooling when the outdoor air temperature is appropriate. Three levels of economizer control are available:

**Basic Economizer Operation:** The MicroTech controller compare the inside and outside temperatures. If the temperature comparison is satisfactory, then free- air economizer operation is used to cool the space. Reheat units also come configured with an indoor humidity sensor.

**Expanded Economizer Operation:** In addition to comparing inside and outside temperatures, outdoor relative humidity is measured to calculate outside air enthalpy. If the enthalpy set point is not exceeded, and the temperature comparison is satisfactory, then free economizer operation is used to cool the space. This helps to minimize the entrance of humid outside air.

**Leading-Edge Economizer Operation:** The MicroTech controller compare both indoor and outdoor temperatures and indoor and outdoor relative humidities. Then it calculates both inside and outside air enthalpy to determine if free economizer operation can cool the space with non-humid outside air. This is a true enthalpy economizer—a first for unit ventilators.

### **Demand Control Ventilation**

The optional unit mounted, single beam absorption infrared gas sensor has a sensing range of 0 – 2000 ppm and voltage output of 0 to 10 VDC (100 ohm output impedance). The pitot tube sensing device is located in the unit ventilator's return air stream. The optional CO2 sensor is used with the UVC's Demand Control Ventilation feature to vary the amount of outside air based on actual room occupancy. With network applications, the unit mounted sensor can be overridden by a remote sensor through the network.

<span id="page-17-0"></span># **End Panels**

Daikin Applied end panels and sub-bases can be used to match up Daikin Applied unit ventilators with existing furniture or units, or with field-supplied storage, sink and bubbler cabinet offerings

One-inch end panels ([Figure 18](#page-17-1)) are typically used to finish off stand-alone floor units. Six-inch end panels, with kick plates, can be used to provide extra space needed for piping ([Figure 19](#page-17-2)). All end panels are individually wrapped in plastic and boxed to help prevent damage during construction.

### <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Wall Sleeves**

The Daikin Applied wall sleeve and louver design is based on a "wet sleeve" concept. In brief, this means the design accommodates the penetration of some moisture into the rear outdoor section of the AEQ unit with provisions for containment and disposal of this moisture to the outdoors. Therefore, proper Louver, Splitter and Wall Sleeve installation is critical.

The wall sleeve must be installed before the AE selfcontained unit ventilator can be placed. The recessed portion of the wall sleeve measures approximately 84", 96" or 108" wide by 28" high and may be recessed into the wall up to 11⅜" in depth. Consult approved Daikin Applied submittal drawings for the job to determine the proper amount of recess, if any, and recommended wall opening size.

The AEQ unit chassis attaches to the wall sleeve threaded studs using 4-nuts and washers.

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Wall Louvers & Grilles**

The louver frame is divided in half horizontally, with make-up and discharge-air stream sections to reduce air recirculation within the vertical louver blade. The upper half of the louver has a blockoff on the exterior side to increase discharge air velocity and improve the throw of leaving air.

The vertical louver can be ordered with flanges that are attached on the outside of all four sides of the louver, resulting in a vertical dimension of 30" (762 mm). Weep holes exist behind the bottom flange of the louver. A diamond pattern expanded aluminum wire mesh (bird screen) is provided on the interior surface of the louver.

The vertical louver is fabricated from 6063-T5 aluminum. The single piece blade has a turned edge along the entering and leaving surface to reduce visibility of the outdoor coil and fan section, and adds rigidity to the blade. The 72-degree offset bend near the middle of the blade creates an air-path turn that minimizes moisture carryover, with a total blade depth of 2¼" (57 mm) in direction of airflow.

#### *Figure 21: Typical Wall Louver and Grille*

The louver is available in the following colors:

- Natural Aluminum finish (paintable 6063-T5 Aluminum)
- Autumn Brown thermosetting urethane powder coat paint electrostatically applied and oven-cured to provide correct chemical cross-linking.
- Dark Bronze thermosetting urethane powder coat paint electrostatically applied and oven-cured to provide correct chemical cross-linking.
- Clear Anodized Aluminum finish

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**VentiMatic™ Shutter Room Exhaust Ventilation**

Outdoor air introduced by the unit ventilator must leave the room in some way. In some states, exhaust vents are required by law or code to accomplish this. The VentiMatic Shutter is a more economical solution to the problem.

The VentiMatic shutter is a continuously variable, gravityactuated room exhaust vent ([Figure 24\)](#page-20-1). It operates in direct response to positive static air pressure created when ventilation air is brought into the room by the unit ventilator. It is a "one-way" shutter that opposes any flow of air into the room.

#### *Figure 24: VentiMatic Shutter*

<span id="page-20-1"></span>**Back (Outdoor Side) Front (Indoor Side)**

<span id="page-20-2"></span>The VentiMatic Shutter's ability to exhaust only the amount of air required results in considerable energy savings. In the heating mode, the unit ventilator will be able to bring in only the required percent minimum outdoor air. Unlike systems that rely on powered exhaust, no energy will be wasted heating excess outdoor air. In the cooling mode, the unit ventilator will be able to bring in 100% outdoor air for full natural or free cooling when it is energy effective.

Since it is not powered, VentiMatic Shutter operation is inherently silent. Unlike other non-powered vents, it opens at an extremely low positive pressure (0.005"). Its shutter flaps are made of temperature-resistant glass fabric impregnated with silicone rubber for flexibility and long life. This fabric retains its original properties down to -50°F.

<span id="page-26-0"></span># **Wall Intake Louvers & Grilles**

Louvers are available with a vertical blade configuration, constructed of heavy-gauge (unpainted, painted, or clear anodized) aluminum.

- The louver is divided in half horizontally to prevent condenser air recirculation.
- A bird screen is provided on the leaving air side of the intake louver.
- Louvers can be supplied with or without flanges:
- Flanged louvers are typically used for a panel wall finish.
- Unflanged louvers are typically used for recessing into a masonry wall.
- An optional (factory-mounted) heavy-duty lattice exterior grille is available with horizontal and vertical lines that "line up" with the louver blades to present an aesthetic appearance.
- Louvers are available in both horizontal and vertical blade configurations:

# <span id="page-29-0"></span>**Selection Procedure**

#### *Step 1: Determine Design Conditions*

Determine design indoor and outdoor air temperatures in accordance with established engineering practices, as outlined in the ASHRAE Guide or other authoritative source. Indoor temperatures of 80°F dry bulb, 67°F wet bulb for summer and 70°F dry bulb for winter usually are acceptable for design or peak load conditions, even though the expected operating conditions of the system may be somewhat different.

### *Step 2: Determine Heating and Cooling Loads*

Calculate design winter heating losses and summer cooling loads in accordance with the procedures outlined by the ASHRAE Guide or other authoritative source. Perhaps the greatest consideration in calculating design loads is solar heat gain. August solar heat values might be used for summer cooling loads, but should not be used for ventilation air or "natural cooling" capacity calculations; since these cooling loads reach their maximum in the spring and autumn months. The natural cooling capacity is usually calculated for 55° or 60°F outdoor air temperature.

#### *Table 8: Outdoor Air Ventilation Sensible Cooling Capacities Based On 75*°*F Room Temperature*


### *Step 3: Determine Air Quantity Required*

Air quantity for heating applications is determined from circulation of a definite number of room air volumes per hour. [Table 9](#page-29-1) gives the recommended number of room air changes per hour.

<span id="page-29-1"></span>



For rooms facing east, south or west, the higher values shown in the table should be used so adequate ventilation cooling will be available to prevent overheating during mild sunny weather. The following equation is helpful to determine the CFM air delivery for any given rate of circulation:

<span id="page-29-2"></span>*Equation 1: CFM For Given Rate Of Circulation*

*Room Volume (cu ft) × Room Changes per Hour <sup>=</sup> CFM 60*

In mechanical cooling applications, the total air quantity may be determined or verified by use of the sensible cooling load equation:

#### *Equation 2: CFM Based On Sensible Cooling Load*

*CFM <sup>=</sup> Q sensible (space) 1.086 x TD*

Q sensible is the maximum sensible room load and T.D. is the temperature difference between the room design dry bulb temperature and the final or leaving-air dry bulb temperature. For these calculations, a T.D. of 20°F is usually assumed to be desirable to avoid delivering air too cold for comfort. This figure may be varied one or two degrees for reasons of practicality.

*Note: The sensible load used in the preceding equation is the space load and excludes the ventilation load.*

Most areas have ventilation codes which govern the amount of ventilation air required for school applications. For other than school applications or areas not having codes, the ASHRAE Guide may be used for authoritative recommendations and discussion of the relation between odor control and outdoor air quantities.

The minimum outdoor air quantity recommended by ASHRAE for K-12 classrooms is 10 CFM per person plus 0.12 CFM/ft2. Lower percent minimum outdoor air settings are more economical. In the interest of economy, it may be desirable to use lower percent minimums if there are no ventilation codes.

### *Step 4: Select Unit Size*

The unit should be selected to meet or exceed the CFM delivery requirement previously determined. All model types are available with nominal capacities of 1000, 1250 and 1500 CFM. Unit sizes 024, 036, 044 and 054.

### **Cooling Capacity**

Unit cooling capacity should be selected to equal or slightly exceed the sum of computed room sensible and latent heat gains (Room Total Capacity). When operating on the mechanical cooling cycle, the control system introduces a constant amount of outdoor air for ventilation. The latent and sensible heat gain from this outdoor ventilation air must be added to the room total cooling load before choosing the proper capacity unit.

30------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-30-0"></span>### **Heating Capacity**

Unit heating capacity should be selected to equal or slightly exceed the computed room heat loss. For units installed for 100% recirculation, it is good practice to increase the heating capacity by 15% to aid in quick room warm-up. This allowance is unnecessary for units delivering a minimum outdoor air of 20% or more, since the outdoor air damper remains closed until the room is up to temperature. The heat normally expended in heating the minimum-percent outdoor air up to room temperature is available for quick warm-up purposes.

The heating required to warm the outdoor ventilating air up to room temperature must also be calculated. The Total Capacity should be used in sizing, piping, boilers, etc.

# **Cooling Selection Example**

#### *Step 1: Determine Design Conditions*

Assume the following design indoor and outdoor air temperatures are given:

- Outdoor design temperature = 96°F DB / 74°F WB
- Room design temperature = 76°F DB / 65°F WB

#### *Step 2: Determine Cooling Loads*

Assume the following cooling loads are given:

- Minimum total capacity (TC) = 37.8 MBH
- Minimum sensible capacity (SC) = 23.9 MBH
- Minimum outdoor air = 20%
- Room volume = 9,000 cubic feet
- Desired number of air changes per hour = 8

### *Step 3: Determine Air Quantity Required*

["Equation 1: CFM For Given Rate Of Circulation" on](#page-29-2)  [page 30](#page-29-2) indicates that to obtain eight room volumes per hour, a unit capable of delivering 1200 CFM standard air must be used, as follows:

CFM = (Room Volume Ft3) × (Room Changes per Hour) 80

CFM = 9000 × 8 <sup>=</sup> <sup>1200</sup> <sup>60</sup>

This indicates that a size 036 Unit Ventilator should be used, which delivers 1250 CFM.

#### *Step 4: Select Unit Size*

Determine the unit performance as follows:

### *Determine Entering Dry Bulb Temperature*

The entering dry bulb (EDB) temperature is calculated using the following formula:

EDB = Room DB × %RA + Outdoor DB × %OA 100 100 EDB = 76(0.8) + (96)(0.2) = 80°F

### *Determine Entering Wet Bulb Temperature*

The entering wet bulb (EWB) temperature is determined by calculating the Enthalpy (H) at saturation, then looking up the corresponding EWB [\(Table 10 on page](#page-31-0)  [32](#page-31-0)). Enthalpy (H) is calculated as follows:

Enthalpy (H) = Room Enthalpy × %RA + Outdoor Enthalpy × %OA 100 100

Enthalpy (H) = 30.06 (0.8) + 37.66 (0.2) = 31.58 btu/lb

Referring to [Table 10 on page 32](#page-31-0), EWB for 31.58 btu/ lb = 67°F

#### *Look Up Capacities*

Look up the Total and Sensible cooling capacity for a Size 036 unit at High Fan Speed from ["Cooling Capacity](#page-28-1)  [Selection Table" on page 29](#page-28-1). Interpolation between the values for Outdoor DB = 90°F and 100°F, at Entering Air Temperature DB/WB = 80/67, will yield the following results.

- 39.7 MBH (TC)
- 26.5 MBH (SC)

Leaving air temperatures dry bulb °F (LDB) and wet bulb

°F (LWB) may be calculated as follows:

$$\text{LDB} = \text{EDB} \cdot \frac{\text{SC(Btuh)}}{\text{CFM} \times 1.085} \quad = \text{80} \quad \cdot \frac{26500}{1250 \times 1.085} = \text{60.4} \cdot \text{°F}$$

$$\text{LMBH} = \text{EWMH} \cdot \text{h} \quad \frac{\text{TC(Buh)}}{\text{CFM} \times 4.5} \quad = \text{31.62} \quad \cdot \frac{39700}{1250 \times 4.5} \quad = \text{24.63}$$

#### *From ["Cooling Capacity Selection Table" on](#page-28-1)  [page 29](#page-28-1):*

LWB at 24.6 H = 57.1°F.

*Note: Interpolation within each table and between sets of tables for each unit series is permissible.*

<span id="page-64-0"></span># **Control Modes and Functions**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators equipped with MicroTech controls can be programmed to operate in a variety of modes based on the current situation in the room and the status of the unit ventilator. Changes in mode can be triggered manually, via network signals, by sensor readings, or by date and time. External inputs and outputs can be used to change modes, communicate data to network controls or change the functional operation of the unit.

### <span id="page-64-2"></span>**Occupancy Modes**

MicroTech controls can be set up to change modes based on room occupancy. Four different occupancy modes are provided, as described below.

### *Occupied Mode*

This is the normal daytime operation mode. The controller maintains a room set point using the outside air capability and other functions.

*Note: For non-school applications, the unit can also be configured to cycle the fan in response to the room load. In this case, the fan would normally be in the Off Mode until heating or cooling is required. The outside air damper is always closed when the fan is off. When the fan starts, the outside air damper opens to the required position, usually minimum position.*

#### *Unoccupied Mode*

This is the night setback operating mode, in which the unit responds to a new room set point and cycles to maintain the condition. The fan comes on when heating or cooling is needed and runs until the load is satisfied. The outdoor air damper is closed during this mode. When a cooling load is satisfied by a refrigerant system, the compressor is de-energized and the unit ventilator indoor fan continues to run for a fixed period of time to remove coldness from the evaporator coil.

### *Stand By Mode*

In this mode, the unit maintains the occupied mode set point temperature with the outdoor air damper closed. The fan runs continuously unless it is configured to cycle in response to the load.

#### *Bypass Mode*

This is a tenant override operating mode initiated by using the optional LUI or by depressing the tenant override switch on the optional room sensor. The unit is place back into occupied mode for a predetermined time (default 120 minutes). This time can be set in 1-minute increments from 1 minute to 240 minutes through the unit ventilator service tool or a network.

### **Economizer Modes**

<span id="page-64-1"></span>Economizer operation is facilitated by the outdoor air damper, which automatically adjusts the above-minimum outside air position to provide free cooling when the outdoor air temperature is appropriate. Three levels of economizer control are available:

#### *Basic Economizer Operation*

The MicroTech controller compare the inside and outside temperatures. If the temperature comparison is satisfactory, then free-air economizer operation is used to cool the space. Reheat units also come configured with an indoor humidity sensor.

#### *Expanded Economizer Operation*

In addition to comparing inside and outside temperatures, outdoor relative humidity is measured to calculate outside air enthalpy. Free economizer operation is used to cool the space. This helps to minimize the entrance of humid outside air.

#### *Leading-Edge Economizer Operation*

The MicroTech controller compare both indoor and outdoor temperatures and indoor and outdoor relative humidities to determine if free economizer operation can cool the space with non-humid outside air. This is a true enthalpy economizer.

### **Night Purge Mode**

Under this mode, the unit is configured to purge the room space for one hour for various reasons (odor or fume removal, drying, etc.).During Night Purge the outside air damper is open full and the fan is run on high speed. No "normal" heating or cooling takes place (the emergency heat set point is maintained) and the exhaust fan, if the room is so equipped, is signaled to turn on.

### **Freeze Prevention Mode**

This mode helps protect the unit ventilator from freezing air conditions. Control functions vary depending on the type of temperature control used by the unit, as follows:

### **Emergency Heat Mode**

If the unit is left in a mode that does not normally allow heating (such as Off, Fan Only, Cool, or Night Purge) and the room temperature falls below 55°F, the unit will heat the space to above 55°F and then return to the previously set mode of operation. This mode of operation can be field configured and/or be disabled.

65------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-65-0"></span>**External Input Functions**

The unit ventilator controller is provided with four (4) binary inputs that allow a single set of dry contacts to be used as a signal to it, and two (2) binary inputs that allow a 24VAC signal. Input signal choices are described below. Multiple units can be connected to a single set of dry contacts.

*Note: Not all of the functions listed can be used at the same time. The unit ventilator controller is provided with configuration parameters that can be adjusted to select which function will be used for these inputs where multiple functions are indicated below.*

#### *Unoccupied Input Signal*

This input signals the unit ventilator controller to go into unoccupied or occupied mode. When the contacts close, the unit ventilator controller goes into unoccupied mode; when the contacts open, it goes into occupied mode. Additional variables can affect occupancy mode and override this binary input. See ["Occupancy Modes" on](#page-64-2)  [page 65](#page-64-2).

#### *Remote Shutdown Input Signal*

This input signals the unit ventilator controller to go into shutdown mode. When the contacts close, the controller goes into shutdown mode; when the contacts open, it returns to normal operation.

#### *Ventilation Lockout Input Signal*

This input signals the unit ventilator controller to close the outdoor air damper. When the contacts close (ventilation lockout signal) the controller closes the outdoor damper; when the contacts open, it returns to normal outdoor damper operation.

### *Exhaust Interlock Input Signal*

This input signals the unit ventilator controller that an exhaust fan within the space has been energized. The controller then repositions the outdoor air damper to a user-adjustable minimum position. When the contacts close (exhaust fan on signal) the controller uses the value defined by the Exhaust Interlock OA Damper Min Position Setpoint as the new minimum outdoor air damper position regardless of the indoor air fan speed. When the contacts open, it returns to normal outdoor damper operation.

# **External Output Functions**

The unit ventilator controller is provided with three (3) binary outputs to perform the functions described below. These are relay type outputs that supply 24VAC.

*Note: Not all of the functions listed can be used at the same time. The unit ventilator controller is provided with configuration parameters that can be adjusted to select which function will be used for these outputs when multiple functions are indicated below.*

#### *Fault Signal*

This relay output provides one set of Normally Open (NO) (reversible through keypad/software) 24VAC contacts that can be used to signal a fault condition. When a fault exists, the unit ventilator controller energizes this relay output. When the fault or faults are cleared, it de-energizes this relay output.

### *Exhaust Fan On/Off Signal*

This relay output provides one set of Normally Open (NO) (reversible through keypad/software) 24VAC contacts that can be used to signal the operation of an exhaust fan. When the outdoor air damper opens more than the Energize Exhaust Fan OA Damper Setpoint, the relay output will signal the exhaust fan on (contacts closed). When the outdoor damper closes below this setpoint, the relay output will signal the exhaust fan off (contacts open).

#### *Auxiliary Heat Signal*

This relay output provides one set of Normally Open (NO) (reversible through keypad/software) 24VAC contacts that can be used to operate an auxiliary heat device. The unit ventilator controller by default is configured to operate a NO auxiliary heat device (deenergize when heat is required) such as a wet heat valve actuator with a spring setup to open upon power failure. However, the Auxiliary Heat Configuration variable can be used to set the controller to use an NC auxiliary heat device (energize when heat is required) such as electric heat.

66------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-66-0"></span>**Advanced Control Options**

MicroTech controls make possible a number of advanced control options that can quickly pay for themselves in saved energy costs and more comfortable classrooms, as described below.

### **Part Load Variable Air Control**

Part Load Variable Air control can be used to automatically adjust the unit ventilator fan speed based upon the room load and the room-temperature PI control loop. This MicroTech control option provides higher latent cooling capabilities and quieter operation during non-peak load periods by basing indoor fan speed upon room load.

During low-load or normal operation (about 60% of the time) the fan will operate on low speed. When the load increases to an intermediate demand, the fan will automatically shift to the medium-speed setting. Under near-design or design-load conditions, the fan will operate on high speed. A built-in, 10-minute delay helps minimize awareness of fan speed changes. Lowspeed fan operation under normal operating conditions, in conjunction with our GentleFlo fan technology contributes to a very quiet classroom environment.

### **Demand-Controlled Ventilation (Optional)**

Daikin Applied unit ventilators can be equipped to use input from a CO2 controller to ventilate the space based on actual occupancy instead of a fixed design occupancy. This Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV) system monitors the amount of CO2 produced by students and teachers so that enough fresh outdoor air is introduced to maintain good air quality. The system is designed to achieve a target ventilation rate (e.g., 15 cfm/person) based on actual occupancy.

By using DCV to monitor the actual occupancy pattern in a room, the system can allow code-specific levels of outdoor air to be delivered when needed. Unnecessary over-ventilation is avoided during periods of low or intermittent occupancy.

With DCV you can be confident that your school is meeting ventilation standards for Indoor Air Quality and that your students are receiving adequate air to be attentive to instruction. At the same time, you are saving money in early morning hours, in between classes, or after hours when classrooms are heated and cooled but not always fully occupied.

### *Acceptance by Codes and Standards*

ASHRAE Standard 62-2004 Ventilation for Indoor Air Quality recognizes CO2 based DCV as a means of controlling ventilation based on occupancy. The ASHRAE standard has been referenced or adopted by most regional and local building codes. This standard references ventilation on a per-person basis.

Using CO2 control will sometimes lower the absolute amount of outside air delivered into a room but will maintain the per-person rate. For example, if a classroom is designed for 30 students, the ventilation rate is 450 cfm (30 students × 15 cfm/student). However, when there are only ten students in the classroom, the CO2 control will adjust ventilation to 150 cfm (10 students × 15 cfm/ student). A minimum base ventilation rate (typically 20% of design levels) is provided when in the occupied mode. This provides outdoor air to offset any interior source contamination while allowing for proper space pressurization.

# **DX System Control**

The unit ventilator controller is configured to operate the compressor as secondary (mechanical) cooling when economizer cooling is available, and as primary cooling when economizer cooling is not available. Additional DX control features include:

### *Compressor Cooling Lockout*

The unit ventilator controller is configured to lock out compressor cooling when the outdoor air temperature falls below the compressor cooling lock out setpoint. Below this temperature setpoint only economizer cooling will be available.

#### *Minimum On and Off Time*

The unit ventilator controller is provided with minimumon and minimum-off timers to prevent adverse compressor cycling (3-minutes default).

#### *Compressor Start Delay Variable*

This variable is intended to be adjusted as part of the start-up procedure for each unit. It is used to prevent multiple unit compressors from starting at the same time after a power failure or after an unoccupied-to-occupied changeover. Each unit should be configured at start-up with a slightly different (random) delay, or groups of units should be provided with different delays.

67------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-67-0"></span>**System Components**

The main components of the MicroTech system are:

- A Unit Ventilator Controller (UVC) with on-board BACnet MS/TP communication
- Optional Local User Interface (LUI)
- Optional Lon plug-in network communication module
- In addition, unit ventilators equipped with MicroTech controllers feature factory-mounted sensors and actuators for system control and feedback.

### **Unit Ventilator Controller**

The MicroTech UVC is a DDC, microprocessor-based controller designed to provide sophisticated comfort control of an economizer-equipped Daikin Applied unit ventilator. In addition to normal operating control, it provides alarm monitoring and alarm-specific component shutdown if critical system conditions occur. Each UVC is factory wired, factory programmed and factory run-tested for the specific unit ventilator model and configuration ordered by the customer.

#### *Figure 18: MicroTech Control Board*

### **Local User Interface (Optional)**

An optional built-in LUI touch pad with digital LED Display is located in the right hand compartment below the top right access door. The LUI features a 4 x 20 OLED digital display, 4 keys, and 2 individual LED indicators. In addition to the operating mode states and fan functions, the touch pad will digitally display:

- The room set point temperature.
- The current room temperature.
- Any fault code for quick diagnostics at the unit.

#### *Figure 19: User Interface Touch Pad*

The User Interface has individual touch-sensitive printed circuit board mounted buttons, and comes with a built-in menu structure (Password Protected) to change many of the common operating variables.

#### *Four Operating Mode States*

Four different user operating mode states can be chosen on the LUI:

**Heat:** Heating and economizer operation only.

**Cool:** Cooling and economizer operation only.

**Fan Only:** Fan only operation.

**Auto:** The unit automatically switches between heating, cooling and economizer operation to satisfy the room load conditions. The current unit state is also displayed.

#### *Four Fan States*

Four fan states are provided on all units: high, medium low and Auto speed modulation. The Auto speed function (part load, variable air) varies the fan speed automatically to meet the room load whether the unit is in heating, cooling or economizer mode.

All this is accomplished with a standard, single-speed NEMA frame motor. A built-in 10-minute delay helps minimize awareness of speed changes. During low-load or normal operation (about 60% of the time) the fan will operate at low speed. The low speed operation, along with GentleFlo fan technology, contributes to a very quiet classroom environment.

When the load increases to an intermediate demand, the fan automatically shifts to the medium speed setting. At near-design or design-load conditions the fan will operate on high speed.

With four fan states and GentleFlo fan technology, there is no need to oversize units or worry about uncomfortable conditions.

### <span id="page-67-1"></span>**Communication Types**

On-board BACnet communication or an optional Lon communication module provide control and monitoring information to your building automation system without the need for costly gateways.

#### *MicroTech Controller with BACnet MS/TP*

The MicroTech® controller allows the UVC to interoperate with systems that use the BACnet (MS/TP) protocol with a conformance level of 3. It meets the requirements of the ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2008 standard for BACnet systems.

#### *LonWorks SCC Communication Module*

This module supports the LonWorks SCC (Space Comfort Communication) profile number 8500-10. Unit controllers are LonMark certified with this optional LonWorks communication module.

### *CO2 Sensor for Demand Controlled Ventilation*

On units equipped for Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV), the UVC is configured to use a 0-2000 PPM, 0-10 VDC, single beam absorption infrared gas sensor. CO2 sensors are available as unit mounted only. An air collection probe (pitot tube and filter) is installed in the return air of the unit ([Figure 40](#page-68-1)).

### **A Wide Variety of Input, Output & Alarm Data Points Available**

A wide variety of data is available from Daikin Applied unit ventilators when equipped with MicroTech unit controllers in a network situation. They provide a clear picture of just what's happening in each classroom and notify your building automation system of alarm conditions regardless of the protocol you select. [Table 14](#page-71-1) below shows a list of inputs, outputs and alarm functions available.

<span id="page-71-1"></span>



*1* Not all data points or alarms listed will be available in all unit ventilator configurations. Humidity and CO2 points require the use of optional sensors.

### **ServiceTools™**

ServiceTools for MicroTech Unit Ventilators is software for operation on a personal computer. This software provides representation of the sequence of operation and enables the service technician to:

- **•** Monitor equipment operation
- **•** Configure network communications
- **•** Diagnose unit operating problems
- **•** Download application code and configure the unit

This software is a purchased tool for service technicians and will run on PCs with Microsoft Windows, Windows 7 and newer operating systems.

This tool provides more capabilities than the unit's user interface touch pad and is highly recommended for startup and servicing. (It may be required for startup and/or servicing, depending upon unit integration and other requirements.) It does not replace BAS functions, such as system wide scheduling or sequencing, and it cannot serve as a Work Station Monitoring package. ServiceTools interfaces with the MicroTech controller using serial communications through a USB type A connector.

### <span id="page-71-0"></span>**Setpoints and Configuration Parameters**

The UVC can save a snapshot of all setpoints and configuration parameters in the controller. Those configurations and setpoints can be saved onto a SD flash memory card (max size of 32GB), ensuring the controller can be reverted to those settings at a later date. Additionally, the settings saved to a SD can be taken to another UVC and loaded into it. Certain parameters, such as BACnet addressing and location, can be optionally restored to prevent duplication.

#### **Data Trending**

Data can be written to an optional SD card inserted into the control unit. The parameters that can be trended through MicroTech can be found in OM 732. Six options for trending frequency are available:

- 
- **•** None 10 Minutes
- **•** Occupancy Change Hourly
	-
- **•** 1 Minute Daily A separate trend file will be created of each day. If a "Daily" trend is selected, the trend file will contain a header and 1 line of data. If an "Hourly" trend is selected, the trend file will contain a header and 24 lines of data. The last 3 alarms in the Alarm History are always recorded.

# <span id="page-72-0"></span>**Why Classrooms Overheat**

Overheated classrooms occur every day in schools in every area of the country. The most serious result is their detrimental effect on students' ability to concentrate and learn. Research has determined that the ability to learn and retain knowledge decreases rapidly as the temperature exceeds recommendations. Overheated rooms also represent wasted fuel, resulting in excessive operating costs.

Correcting an overheating problem in an existing building is very difficult and expensive. It calls for redesign and alteration of the heating and ventilating system, necessitating considerable renovation. This potential problem should be recognized, understood and planned for when heating and ventilating systems are designed for new and existing buildings.

### **Schools Have Special Needs**

Schools have unique heating and ventilating needs, in large part because of their variable occupancy and usage patterns. Fewer cubic feet of space is provided per student in a school building than in any other type of commercial or public building. School classrooms are typically occupied only six hours a day, five days a week, for only three-fourths of the year, with time out for vacations. All in all, this represents approximately 15% of the hours in a year that a classroom is occupied.

To understand the overheating problem in schools, one must first realize that the excess heat comes from what is commonly termed "uncontrolled heat sources." To gain some perspective on how this affects heating and cooling decisions, let's take a look at a typical classroom in the northern section of the mid western United States.

Suppose we have a classroom that is 24 by 38 feet with 10-foot ceilings and 100 square feet of window area along the outside wall. At an outside temperature of 0°F and a desired room temperature of 72°F, let's assume the normal amount of heat loss from the room to the outside is 55,000 BTUs per hour.

As the outside temperature changes, so does the amount of heat that the room loses. This is represented in [Figure](#page-72-1)  [45](#page-72-1) by Room Heat Loss Line A, which ranges from 55,000 BTUs per hour at 0°F outside air temperature to zero BTUs at 70°F. Obviously, if the heating system were the only source of heat in the classroom, the solution would be simple: The room thermostat would cause the heating system to supply exactly the amount of heat required to maintain the room at the thermostat temperature setting. In reality, the introduction of excess heat from a variety of uncontrolled sources makes the challenge considerably more complex.

#### *Figure 45: Heat Gain Vs. Heat Loss In Occupied Classrooms*

<span id="page-72-1"></span>#### *As [Figure 45](#page-72-1) illustrates, even in very cold weather an occupied classroom is more likely to require cooling than heating.*

#### *Heat From Students*

Body heat generated by students in a classroom is one of the three primary sources of uncontrolled heat. In a typical classroom of 30 students, the amount of heat given off at all times will vary according to factors such as age, activity, gender, etc. A conservative estimate is 260 BTUs per hour per pupil. Multiply this by 30 and you get a total of 7,800 BTUs per hour added to the room by the students alone. This excess heat is noted in [Figure](#page-72-1)  [45](#page-72-1) as "Heat Gain from Students."

#### *Heat Gain From Lights*

Heat emitted by the lighting system constitutes a second uncontrolled heat source. Artificial lighting is needed in most classrooms even during daylight hours to prevent unbalanced lighting and eye strain. A typical classroom requires approximately 2,500 watts of supplemental lighting to provide properly balanced lighting. Fluorescent lights add heat to the room at the rate of 3.4 BTU per watt per hour, or a total of 8,500 BTU per hour. This extra heat is represented in [Figure 45](#page-72-1) as "Heat Gain from Lights."

Add the heat gain from lighting to the 7,800 BTUs introduced by student body heat and we now have an extra 16,300 BTU/HR being introduced into the classroom by uncontrolled sources. This heat gain remains constant regardless of the outdoor air temperature.

#### *Solar Heat Gain*

The sun is a third uncontrolled source of heat. And, because it is neither positive nor constant, calculating its contribution to the overall heat gain is difficult. Solar heat gain can be the worst offender of the three in classrooms with large windows. Indirect or reflected solar radiation is substantial even on cloudy days, even in rooms with north exposure, as a result of what is termed "skyshine."

73------------------------------------------------



To get an idea of the potential effect of the sun, let's assume that the solar heat gain in our hypothetical classroom will peak at 240 BTU/HR per square foot of glass area. If we then assume a glass area of 100 square feet and at least 100 BTU/HR per square foot of glass for solar heat gain, we can calculate a very conservative estimate of 10,000 BTU/HR heat gain through windows. If we add this to the heat from the lights and body heat, total heat gain adds up to 26,300 BTU/HR from sources other than the heating and ventilating system. This is indicated in [Figure 45 on page 73](#page-72-1) by the top horizontal line, which intersects Room Heat Loss Line A at approximately 37°F. This is a reasonable estimate of the maximum uncontrolled heat gain that can be received in the typical classroom from these common heat sources.

#### *The Analysis*

From [Figure 45 on page 73](#page-72-1) it is evident that, at an outside temperature of 48°F or higher, the heat given off by 30 students and classroom lighting is sufficient to cause overheating. This is true even if the classroom is occupied at night when solar heat gain is not a factor. But, since classrooms are occupied during the day, solar addition provides heat in varying amounts even in classrooms with north exposures. Consequently, the heating and ventilating system in our typical classroom must provide cooling at all times when the outdoor temperature is above 48°F and at any time during colder weather when the solar heat gain exceeds room heat loss.

If we assume an average winter temperature of approximately 33°F in the region where our typical classroom is located, we know that, half of the time, both night and day, the outside temperature will be above 33°F. However, since it is generally warmer during the day, when school is in session, the heating and ventilating system will be required to provide cooling for this classroom during much of the time that the room is occupied.

In this example, we've assumed that our classroom had a room heat loss of 55,000 BTU/HR at a design outdoor air temperature of 0°F (Room Heat Loss Line "A"). Bear in mind, however, that the recent trend in "energysaving" building design often results in rooms with lower room heat loss, as indicated by Room Heat Loss Lines "B", "C," and "D." At 0°F design outdoor air temperature:

- Room "B" has a room heat loss of 45,000 BTU/HR,
- Room "C" has a room heat loss of 35,000 BTU/HR,
- Room "D" has a room heat loss of 25,000 BTU/HR.

Note the lowering of the temperature above which cooling will always be required as the room heat loss decreases.

We've noted that cooling is always required in Classroom "A" when outdoor air temperatures exceed 48°F. In Classroom "B," "C," and "D" cooling is always required when outdoor temperatures exceed 44°, 36° and 23°F, respectively [\(Figure 45 on page 73](#page-72-1)).

Now that we understand the reason for classrooms overheating, the solution is simple: The heating and ventilating system must provide cooling to take care of the heat given off in the classroom by uncontrolled heat sources.

#### *Cooling The Classroom*

The Daikin Applied unit ventilator has become a standard for heating and ventilating systems in schools because it provides the solution for overheating classrooms. The unit ventilator cools as well as heats. During the heating season the outdoor air temperature is nearly always below the desired room temperature. It stands to reason then that the outside air should be used to provide the cooling necessary to keep classrooms down to thermostat temperature.

The classroom unit ventilator does just that. By incorporating an automatically controlled outdoor air damper, a variable quantity of outdoor air is introduced in the classroom, metered exactly to counteract overheating. Since our problem is more one of cooling than of heating, it is evident that more than just the room heat loss must be determined to design a good heating and ventilating system. The cooling requirements should be assessed as well, and the free-cooling capacity of the equipment specified along with the heating capacity required. If this is done, the optimum learning temperature can be maintained in each classroom.

<span id="page-74-0"></span># **Meeting IAQ Requirements**

Good indoor air quality (IAQ), which is important in the home and at work, is no less important to students and faculty in schools. For the past several years, efforts to reduce energy costs in new school buildings have seen the use of tighter construction, sealed windows and heavier insulation. While these construction techniques have helped reduce energy costs, tightly sealed buildings, or envelopes, when combined with increased use of recirculated air, have led to a condition known as sick building syndrome.

In a poorly ventilated school building, fumes and vapors from plastics and other synthetics are often not properly exhausted, while mold, fungus, and bacteria are able to flourish. These conditions can cause various ailments, including nausea, smarting eyes, and coughing, as well as increased student absenteeism and diminished productivity.

For these reasons, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) now has recommendations for minimum ventilations rates for various types of classrooms and no longer endorses the practice of little or no usage of outdoor air.

### **Following ASHRAE Control Cycle II**

ASHRAE Cycle II is a very economical sequence of control because only minimum amounts of outdoor air are heated and free outdoor air—natural cooling—is available to offset the large internal heat gain associated with the dense occupancy of classrooms.

Daikin Applied unit ventilators are normally controlled according to ASHRAE Control Cycle II. ASHRAE control cycles apply only to heating, heating-and-ventilating and free-cooling operation. (For more information on the ASHRAE Control Cycle II sequence, see [Figure 46 on](#page-76-1)  [page 77](#page-76-1).)

Under ASHRAE Cycle II, the outdoor air damper is closed during warmup of the room. As the room temperature approaches the thermostat setting, the outdoor air damper opens to a predetermined minimum percentage of outside air. The heating coil capacity controller then modulates to maintain the thermostat setting.

If the room temperature rises above the thermostat setting, the heating coil is turned off and the outdoor air damper opens beyond the minimum position to maintain the thermostat setting.

**EXAMPLE:** For a 60°F entering air mixture temperature and 70°F room temperature, with 30°F outdoor air temperature, 25% outdoor air will produce the 60°F mixture air temperature. When the outdoor air temperature drops to 10°F, 12.5% outdoor air will produce the 60°F mixture air temperature.

### **Night Setback**

Substantial fuel savings can be realized by operating the unit ventilator system at a reduced room setting at night and during other unoccupied periods, such as weekends and holidays. If the space temperature falls below the setting of the unoccupied thermostat, the unit fans will be brought on to provide additional heat. Units with electric heat coils do not provide convective heat. The electric coil and the unit fans will be brought on to maintain the thermostat setting.

### **Typical Temperature Control Components**

In general, unit ventilators require the following basic DDC electrical components in order to operate on any of the standard unit ventilator ASHRAE cycles of control. The control components listed in this section are for familiarization purposes only and should not be construed as a bill of material.

#### *Outdoor Air Damper Actuator*

This is a modulating device under the control of the room and discharge sensors. It positions the outdoor air damper to admit the amount of outdoor air required at any given point in the control cycle. The room air damper is mechanically linked to the outdoor air damper, which permits the use of a single actuator. Electric actuators should be of the spring-return type so that the outdoor air damper closes whenever the electric power supply to the unit is interrupted.

#### *Discharge Airstream Sensor*

This device overrides the room sensor and modulates the outdoor air damper toward the closed position when the unit discharge air falls to a potentially uncomfortable temperature.

#### *Electric Heat Step Control*

A modulating step controller, under control of the room sensor, steps individual electric heating elements on and off as required. Staging relays are sometimes used in lieu of a step controller.

75------------------------------------------------



### <span id="page-75-0"></span>**Additional Components**

Additional components may be required depending on the specific application. They include:

#### *Room Temperature Sensor Chamber:*

When the Room Temperature Sensor is to be mounted within the unit ventilator rather than on the wall, it is located behind a series of holes in the unit front panel with the sensing element sealed within the room temperature chamber. The room temperature chamber is a standard feature with units furnished with MicroTech controls. All units come with a factory mounted room temperature sensor.

#### *DX Cooling Low Ambient Lockout:*

This lockout must be used on DX systems to lock out the condensing unit when the outdoor air temperature is below 64°F (17.5°C). This device must be integrated into the control system so that the unit has full ventilation cooling capability during the lockout period.

### *DX Low Temperature Limit:*

This limit must be used on DX cooling units to deenergize the compressor when the refrigerant falls below freezing. DX units with MicroTech controls have a factory-installed sensor on the return bend of the DX coil that provides a sample of the coil's temperature.

### **Two-Stage Compressors**

Our self-contained units with the two-stage compressor will run on lower fan speeds up to 70% of the time, improving comfort through better humidity control and quieter operation, while minimizing issues with over sizing. The unit is designed to operate in low compression mode while in medium and low fan speed. The reduced cooling capacity in the medium and low fan speed will allow the system to run longer at moderate and low load conditions providing better humidity control. When the high capacity is needed the high speed will provide high compression and full capacity cooling.

# **Coil Selection**

All coils have their own unshared fin surfaces (some manufacturers use a continuous fin surface, sacrificing proper heat transfer). The result is maximum efficiency of heat transfer, which promotes comfort and reduces operating costs.

An air break between coils in all Daikin Applied units is used to enhance decoupling of heat transfer surfaces providing full capacity output, comfort and reduced operating costs.

Direct expansion (DX) coils are constructed of aluminum fins with a formed, integral spacing collar. The fins are mechanically bonded to the seamless copper tubes by expansion of the tubes after assembly. Fins are rippled or embossed for strength and increased heat transfer surface.

### **Long Lasting Electric Heating Coils**

With our draw-thru design, electric coils are directly exposed to the air stream. They come with a built-in switch to de-energize the coil when the center front panel is removed. A unit-mounted disconnect switch is included. A continuous electric sensory element for high temperature is not required because the air is drawn smoothly and evenly across the coils, prolonging life. (Blow-thru designs use cal rods inserted into the tube of a fin tube coil that results in reduced heat transfer. The constant movement of the electric heating cal rod within the tube shortens life.)

76------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-76-0"></span># **ASHRAE Cycle II**

We strongly recommend that ASHRAE Cycle II be implemented with all unit ventilators using controls by others. ASHRAE Cycle II is a very economical sequence since only the minimum amount of outside air is conditioned and free natural cooling is available.

During warm-up (any classroom temperature 3°F or more below heating setpoint), the outdoor air damper is closed and the unit conditions only room air. As room temperature approaches the heating setpoint the outdoor air damper opens to a position that permits a predetermined minimum amount of outside air to be drawn in. Unit capacity is then controlled as needed to maintain room setpoints. If room temperature rises above room cooling setpoint, and the outside air is adequate for economizer cooling, then the outdoor air damper may open above the minimum position to provide economizer cooling.

ASHRAE Cycle II requires that a minimum of three temperature measurements be made:

- **1.** Classroom temperature.
- **2.** Unit discharge air temperature.
- **3.** Outdoor air temperature.

Additionally, the control sequence should incorporate a Discharge Air Low Limit function which requires a discharge air temperature sensor and can override classroom temperature control in order to maintain a discharge air temperature setpoint of 55°F.

When the discharge air temperature drops below 55°F, the discharge-air low-limit function will disable cooling (if enabled) and modulate the unit's heating capability as needed to maintain the 55°F discharge-air setpoint regardless of room temperature.

If the unit's heating capability reaches 100%, then the discharge air low-limit function will modulate the outdoor air damper toward closed to maintain the 55°F discharge air setpoint. Outdoor air temperature is used to determine when to use economizer as a first stage of cooling, and when to use mechanical or hydronic cooling as the first stage of cooling.

- *Note: If outdoor air temperature is not adequate for free cooling, secondary mechanical cooling can be used in place of economizer cooling. A low discharge air function is used to help maintain comfort and provide additional equipment protection by preventing the discharge air from falling too low (typically 55°F), and may force the outdoor air damper toward closed to maintain the discharge air temperature regardless of room temperature.)*

<span id="page-77-0"></span># **Unit Installation**

Carefully arrange the location and installation of each model AEQ unit to provide convenient service access for maintenance and, if necessary, removal of the unit. The installation consists of four basic elements in the following order:

- **1. Louver**
- **2. Galvanized Wall Sleeve**
- **3. Horizontal Air Splitters by others (if required)**
- **4. AEQ Self-contained Unit Ventilator**

The louver brings in outdoor air for the condenser fan section and ventilation air to the classroom while providing a path for heated condenser air to exit.

The Wall Sleeve secures the unit, provides a watertight and air tight seal to the building and brings in electrical and control wiring (if required). It contains the unit main power disconnect switch which is located in the wall sleeve junction box. All field electrical connections are made inside this box.

Horizontal Air Splitters provide proper air paths and minimize air recirculation.

The AEQ self-contained unit ventilator provides comfort cooling and heating for the space. The Model AEQ unit is designed to be installed into or up against an exterior wall. The louver, air splitters (if required) and wall sleeve are installed before the AEQ unit is installed.

On many jobs, the louver and wall sleeve are shipped ahead of the unit itself. Installation instructions for these components are shipped with the individual components included in this publication.

The following are general instructions for suggested applications. In all cases, good engineering practices and local codes must be followed.

### **Condensate Piping:**

Daikin Applied AEQ unit ventilators are designed for condensate removal into a condensate disposal system. Do not connect the unit drain connection so that condensate exits to the outside and/or is exposed to freezing temperatures. Installer is responsible for any damage that might be caused from freezing condensate.

#### *Figure 47: Typical Self-Contained Unit Ventilator Installation*

78------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-78-0"></span>## **Wall Louvers**

The outdoor air wall louver is usually set directly back of the unit ventilator. The position of the wall louver is determined in general by the building construction. The top of the lower channel of the louver frame should be at least 1/2" below the level of the inlet to the unit ventilator.

However, if a high intake opening is necessary, the top of this opening should be not more than 28" above the surface upon which the unit ventilator will set.

#### *Figure 44: Wall Penetrations Detail*

#### *Notes:*

- *1. Horizontal splitter (by others) must be installed whenever there is any space between the wall sleeve and the louver. It is necessary to seal the ends of the wall opening.*
- *2. The top and two sides of the louver must be caulked water tight. The bottom edge of the louver must not be caulked, to allow for drainage.*
- *3. Louvers may be recessed a maximum of 2" (51mm) from the exterior face of the wall.*

- *4. Drain must be flush with floor to allow unit installation and removal. Unit drain tube is 7/8" (22mm) O.D. copper.*
- *5. A field-supplied air seal should be applied to the exterior perimteter of the wall sleeve when unit is installed with no recess.*

# **Lintels**

When brickwork is built up to the top of the intake, lintels must be used above the wall louvers. While the wall is still wet, finish the brick on the top, bottom and both sides of the intake opening with 1/2" cement mortar. With the standard location of the wall louver, the bottom of the intake opening must slope from the louver frame up toward the intake opening to a point 1" above the finished base of the unit.

If a metal sleeve connection is to be used between the unit ventilator and the wall louver, this sleeve must be installed after the unit ventilator is set, making a weather-tight connection to the unit ventilator cabinet. Turn the sleeve over the edge of the louver frame by proper peening before the louver is finally installed.

<span id="page-80-0"></span>### **Interior Considerations**

The interior wall surface behind the unit ventilator must be smooth and level. A wall that is slightly out of plumb can cause major problems with outside air leakage into the room and unit. This could cause drafts and potentially freeze coils.

Be certain that no gap is left between the unit and the outside air louver opening. Otherwise, outside air can leak into the room.

A rubberized, self-adhering membrane around the outside air opening can be used to seal any air or water leaks that might result from construction. Provide a seal under the unit to prevent air infiltration. In addition, seal the unit top and side perimeters to prevent unnecessary air infiltration due to uneven walls.

### **Indoor Air Exhaust Considerations**

All outdoor air introduced by the unit ventilator must leave the room in some way. In some states, exhaust vents are required by law. In states where vents are not required by law, a decision must be made about how best to handle this problem.

The venting system chosen should have the ability to exhaust varying amounts of air equal to the amount of outside air introduced by the floor unit ventilator. A constant volume system, such as a powered exhaust, is unable to respond to changing conditions. It will either exhaust too much air, resulting in a negative pressure, which draws in more outdoor air than desired. Or, it will exhaust too little air, resulting in increased positive pressure, which restricts the amount of outside air being brought into the room.

The Daikin Applied Ventimatic shutter is a more economical solution to the problem. See ["Accessories"](#page-20-2)  [on page 21](#page-20-2) for information on this system and its proper installation.
