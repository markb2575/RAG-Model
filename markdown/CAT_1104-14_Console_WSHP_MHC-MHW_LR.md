<span id="page-4-0"></span># **Introduction**

More than 30 years ago, McQuay (Now Daikin Applied) designed the first complete line of water source heat pumps for high efficiency, individually-zoned comfort control in offices, schools, assisted living facilities, manufacturing facilities and other commercial buildings. Our reputation for outstanding reliability and quiet operation has been reinforced in thousands of successful installations.

Enfinity water source heat pumps incorporate the best of our past and the best of what's new. Using feedback from building owners, consulting engineers, contractors and service engineers, we designed Enfinity products to give you maximum flexibility to design, install, operate and maintain the ideal water source heat pump system for your building project. And we incorporated non-ozone depleting R-410A refrigerant, which–along with high Energy Efficiency Ratios (EER's)–helps preserve our environment and precious energy resources.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Configuration**

Console water source heat pumps are available in five cooling capacity sizes, from 1⁄2 through 1½ tons, (1757 to 5274 watts). Each is available in four different configurations.

Flat top units meet the traditional requirements for a rugged unit. Slope top units offer a more modern look. The high silhouette unit is 25" (635mm) high and the low silhouette unit is only 22½" (572mm) high. The overall unit dimensions are very compact; unit sizes 007 through 012 are 46" (1168mm) long and sizes 015 through 018 are 54" (1372mm) long. All units are a constant 10¾" (273mm) deep for minimum floor space and a consistent "look" for all unit sizes.

All units incorporate a slide-out chassis concept which allows it to be installed easily or removed and replaced quickly when service is required to minimize downtime for the space the unit serves. The cabinet is made up of individual panels, each of which can be easily removed to expose the chassis for field hook-up of water and electrical connections. The chassis easily slides off the subbase for service or changeout.

# **Cabinet**

All cabinets are painted with optional Antique Ivory or Cupola White baked enamel finish for an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The discharge grilles and subbase can be Oxford Brown or match the cabinetry on flat top or slope top units.

The shallow 22 degree slope top cabinet is constructed of 18-gauge steel. The top and side corners and grille are constructed of tough, impact-resistant ABS polycarbonate. The grille extends to the front and sides for a smooth look as well as providing a curtain stop in back. The discharge grilles can be rotated to direct the air in an 11 degree angle from the vertical and can be reversed for a 33 degree discharge angle. The control door has a finger slot and simply lifts up for access to the thermostat. Overall, the slope top unit allows minimal airflow interference from curtains and objects resting on the cabinet, while at the same time providing a rugged, aesthetically pleasing look.

The flat top cabinet is constructed of 18-gauge steel with grille options that meet basic needs with its rugged construction and its 11 degree discharge angle.

# **Chassis**

The chassis houses the fan section, refrigerant circuit and controls. The air enters through the bottom of the chassis, through the subbase or through the front panel in low sill units.

The refrigeration system includes a rotary compressor, reversing valve, coaxial heat exchanger, capillary tubes, air coil, high and low side access valves, and safety controls. Access to the compressor is through a removable end panel. The compressor is isolated from the unit with external vibration mounts, mass plate/viscoelastic dampening material and the compartment is totally insulated to make the quietest console unit on the market. Safety

controls include low temperature (freezestat) and refrigerant high pressure switches. The control box is hinged for easy access to all of the controls. The MicroTech III unit controller offers both standalone or communicating (LonWorks or BACnet) control options.

Each uses a printed circuit board for clean wiring and a low voltage control circuit with a 50 VA transformer. See on [page 8](#page-7-1) for more detailed information. Main power is made to a chassis-mounted 2" x 4" (51mm x 102mm) junction box.

The fan section employs Daikin's Gentleflo tangential system fan and efficient, two-speed PSC motor for selectable airflow and/or noise level. Access to the fan wheel is made through the top panel. The motor is secured to the chassis with three screws for easy service. Water piping connections are 5/8" O.D. copper tubing (sweat connection stubs) and terminate away from the side of the chassis in the piping compartment for easy access. Unique left- and right-hand piping (includes condensate and electrical) locations are available. The 3⁄4" (19mm) I.D. flexible clear vinyl condensate drain tube is internally trapped and extends 14" (356mm) into the piping compartment for easy connection. Piping (electrical and condensate also) can enter through the back wall or through the floor within the subbase. The chassis allows for a piping compartment between the chassis and the cabinet.

# **Optional factory installed features**

Boilerless system electric heat eliminates the need for a boiler in the heat pump water loop. An electric heater is added to the discharge side of the fan scroll. If the entering water temperature falls to 58°F (15°C) the thermostat locks out compressor operation. On a call for heat, the electric heater is energized. When the entering water temperature raises, the unit will resume compressor operation on a call for heat. An emergency electric heat override plug allows for electric heat, if the compressor (mechanical) heat should fail. Each unit has various heater sizes to select from. Not available on 115 volt units. Not CSA listed.

# **Extended end pocket (high sill units)**

Optional extended cabinet end pocket for high sill units, provides 11" of additional area inside the left or right end pocket for piping or a field-installed pump.

# **Multi-directional grilles**

Selectable plastic Multi-Directional Grilles can rotate 90, 180 or 270 degrees for added control of discharge air direction.

## **2", 4", 6" cabinet rear extension (high sill units)**

The optional, factory-installed rear extension for (high sill units only) provides extended space between the wall and unit for piping.

8------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-8-0"></span># **MicroTech® III unit controller**

The MicroTech III Unit Controller is a microprocessorbased control board conveniently located in the unit control box for easy access through a removable access panel. The standalone unit controller is a hard wired interface and provides all the necessary field connections. The board can be wired for 24-volt AC output to the wall thermostat by using terminals R & C. An LED annunciator is located on the front corner of the unit chassis to quickly check the operating status of the unit.

## **MicroTech III operating features**

Assumes cycle fan operation-not continuous fan operation:

- **Start-up –** The unit will not operate until all the inputs and safety controls are checked for normal conditions.
- **Cooling mode** On a call for cooling, the compressor and fan will start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is energized, the reversing valve output will be de-energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off.
- **Heating mode** On a call for heating, the compressor and fan start after the various control timers have expired. If the reversing valve output is de-energized, the reversing valve output will be energized 5 seconds after the compressor has been energized. When the load is satisfied, the compressor and fan shut off. The reversing valve remains energized.
- **Short cycle protection & random start** After power cycle or deactivation of certain alarms, or when leaving the unoccupied mode, a new random compressor start-delay time between 300 and 360 seconds is generated. The random start timer prevents compressors in different units from starting simultaneously. Compressor minimum OFF (360 sec) and compressor minimum ON (180 sec) timers prevent compressor short cycling.
- **Unoccupied mode –** A simple "grounded" signal between terminals U and C (no power source required), puts the unit into the unoccupied mode for night setback operation.
- **Override mode –** A switch on the deluxe automatic changeover thermostat can be activated during the unoccupied mode to put the unit back into the occupied mode for two hours for after-hours heating or cooling.
- **Motorized valve/pump restart –** The IV/PR (H8) terminals on the The MicroTech III unit controller are used to energize (open) a motorized valve or start a water pump to get water circulating prior to starting the compressor on call for heating or cooling. The IV/PR (H8) terminal may be "daisy chained" between 200 units.
- **Brownout protection –** The MicroTech III unit controller measures the input voltage and will suspend compressor and fan operation if the voltage falls below 80% of the unit nameplate rated value. A unique LED status is generated and an output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.
- **Unit shutdown –** A simple grounded signal puts the unit into the shutdown mode. Compressor and fan operations are suspended. A unique LED status is generated and an output signal is made available for connection to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.
- **Condensate overflow protection –** The MicroTech III unit controller incorporates a liquid sensor at the top of the drain pan. Upon sensing water, cooling operation is suspended and an LED status is generated.
- **Remote reset of automatic lockouts** The Remote Reset feature provides the means to remotely reset some lockouts generated by high-pressure and/or lowtemperature faults. When the MicroTech III unit controller is locked out due to one of these faults, and the cause of the fault condition has been cleared, energizing the O-terminal for 11 seconds or more forces the MicroTech III unit controller to clear the lockout. Cycling unit power also clears a lockout if the conditions causing the fault have been alleviated.
- **Intelligent alarm reset** The Intelligent Reset feature helps to minimize nuisance trips of automatic lockouts caused by low-temperature faults. This feature clears faults the first two times they occur within a 24-hour period and triggers an automatic lockout on the 3rd fault. The retry count is reset to zero every 24 hours.
- **Equipment protection control –** The MicroTech III unit controller receives separate input signals from the refrigerant high-pressure switch and the low suction line temperature sensor. In a high-pressure situation, compressor operation is suspended. In a low temperature situation, the unit goes into a defrost cycle where the unit is put into cooling operation for 60 seconds until the coaxial heat exchanger is free of ice. Each switch generates its own unique LED status and output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat if either situation exists.
- **Note:** Most unit fault conditions are the result of operating the equipment outside the unit specifications.

| Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up. Jumper JP3 is factory set for water freeze protection with the jumper open. Operation at fluid temperatures below 32°F with anti-freeze protection requires JP3 to be field configured for the jumper closed. If unit is employing a fresh water system (no anti-freeze protection), it is extremely important that JP3 jumper setting remains in the open position (factory default setting) in order to shut down the unit at the appropriate water temperature to protect your heat pump from freez- ing. Failure to do so can result in unit damage, property damage and will void unit warranty. | Proper antifreeze/water solution is required to minimize the potential of fluid freeze-up.

### *Figure 3: Cooling refrigeration cycle*

When the wall thermostat calls for COOLING, the reversing valve directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger. There, the heat is removed by the water, and the hot gas condenses to become a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil. The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the air passing over the surfaces of the coil. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Water source heat pump systems**

Water source heat pump systems are one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly systems available for heating and cooling buildings. High-efficiency, self contained units (sizes 7,000 btuh to 420,000 btuh) can be placed in virtually any location within a building. Each unit responds only to the heating or cooling load of the individual zone it serves. This permits an excellent comfort level for occupants, better control of energy use for building owners and lower seasonal operating costs. The Air-Conditioning Refrigeration Institute (ARI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) publish standards so that water source heat pumps are rated for specific applications. The ARI/ISO loop options shown in this catalog are typical water source heat pump loop choices available in today's market. These systems offer benefits ranging from low cost installation to the highest energy efficiency available in the market today.

# **Boiler / tower applications: AHRI 320 / ISO 13256-1**

A "Boiler/Tower" application uses a simple two-pipe water circulating system that adds heat, removes heat or transfers rejected heat to other units throughout the building. The water temperature for heating is generally maintained between 65ºF – 70ºF and is usually provided by a natural gas or electric boiler located in a mechanical room. The condensing water temperature, during cooling months, is maintained between 85ºF and 95ºF and requires the use of a cooling tower to dissipate waste heat. Cooling towers can be located on the roof, or inside or adjacent to the building. This application can be the lowest cost of the loop options available.

Note: ASHRAE 90.1 standards require that circulating pumps over 10 HP will require use of "variable frequency drive" equipment and pipe insulation to be used whenever water temperatures are below 60 degrees and above 105 degrees. See ASHRAE 90.1 Standards for details.

*Figure 5: Boiler/tower application*

# **Open loop well water applications: AHRI 325 / ISO 13256-1**

"Open Loop" well water systems use ground water to remove or add heat to the interior water loop. The key benefit of an open loop system is the constant water temperature, usually 50ºF to 60ºF, which provides efficient operation at a low first cost. Most commercial designers incorporate a heat exchanger to isolate the building loop from the well water. Using heat exchangers can reduce maintenance issues while still allowing the transfer of heat from unit to unit as with the "Boiler/ Tower System". A successful design provides an ample amount of groundwater (approximately 2 GPM per ton) and adequate provisions for discharging water back to the aquifer or surface. Open Loop applications are commonly used in coastal areas where soil characteristics allow reinjection wells to return the water back to the aquifer. Note that some states have requirements on the depths of return water reinjection wells, and such wells must be approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Also, bad water quality can increase problems with heat exchanger scaling. Suspended solids can erode the heat exchanger. Strainers can be used to contain suspended solids.

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Closed loop geothermal applications: AHRI 330/ISO 13256-1**

"Vertical Closed Loop" applications are installed by drilling vertical bore holes into the earth and inserting a plastic polyethylene supply/return pipe into the holes. The vertical wells are connected in parallel reverse return fashion to allow the water from the building to circulate evenly throughout the bore field. The circulating fluid dissipates heat to the ground in a similar manner as a "tower" and adds heat back to the loop like a boiler. If properly designed, the loop field can maintain the loop temperatures necessary to condition the building without the use of a boiler or a tower. Loop temperatures usually range from 37ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates.

Southern applications can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. The number of bore holes and their depth should be determined by using commercial software that is specifically designed for vertical geothermal applications. Typical bore depths of a vertical loop range from 150 to 400 feet and generally require about 250 feet of surface area per ton of cooling.

*Figure 7: Vertical loop application*

A closed loop "Horizontal" geothermal application is similar to a vertical loop application with the exception that the loops are installed in trenches approximately 5 feet below the ground surface. The piping may be installed using a "four-pipe" or "six-pipe" design and could require 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of surface area per ton of cooling. Loop temperatures for a commercial application can range from 35ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern climates can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. Horizontal loops are generally not applied in urban areas because land use and costs can be prohibitive. New advances in installation procedures have improved the assembly time of horizontal loops while keeping the first cost lower than a vertical loop.

### *Figure 8: Horizontal loop application*

A "Surface Water" or "Lake" closed loop system is a geothermal loop that is directly installed in a lake or body of water that is near the building. In many cases, the body of water is constructed on the building site to meet drainage or aesthetic requirements. Surface loops use bundled polyethylene coils that are connected in the same manner as a vertical or horizontal loop using a parallel reverse return design. The size and the depth of the lake is critical. Commercial design services should be used to certify that a given body of water is sufficient to withstand the building loads. Loop temperatures usually range from 35ºF to 90ºF and prove to be the best cooling performer and lowest cost loop option of the three geothermal loops. Some applications may not be good candidates due to public access or debris problems from flooding.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Application considerations**

# **Typical console installation**

## **Unit location**

The Console Water Source Heat Pump is typically installed on an exterior wall.

Locate a Console unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access.

To reduce noise emissions, install a field-provided 1/4 inch thick, rubber isolator pad below the entire base of the unit. The pad should be equal to the overall foot-print size of the unit to provide sound dampening of the unit while in operation. The unit must sit flat on the floor to prevent unwanted noise and vibration.

# **Piping**

The console water source heat pump unit is typically connected to the supply / return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydronic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

## **Condensate drain**

The factory provided condensate drain trap on the console unit is located inside the end cabinet. Condensate removal piping must be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

Daikin has available optional fire-rated flexible hoses to better facilitate supply and return piping connections. These flexible hoses reduce vibration between the unit and the rigid piping system. See Catalog 1196 for more detailed hose kit features.

# <span id="page-22-0"></span>**Unit selection**

Achieving optimal performance with water source heat pump systems requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Use a building load program to determine the heating and cooling loads of each zone prior to making equipment selections. With this information, the Daikin SelectTools™ software selection program for Water Source Heat Pumps can be used to provide fast, accurate and complete selections of all Daikin water source heat pump products. SelectTools software is available by contacting your local Daikin Representative.

While we recommend that you use Daikin SelectTools software for all unit selections, manual selections can be accomplished using the same zone load information and the capacity tables available in this catalog.

### *Boiler / tower application manual selections:*

The following example illustrates a typical selection for a zone in a boiler/tower system for a commercial building. A building load program determines that this zone needs 10,430 Btuh of total cooling, 6,950 Btuh of sensible cooling and 9,150 Btuh of total heating. The water temperatures for the boiler/tower system are 90ºF for cooling and 70ºF for heating. The return air temperature is 80ºF dry bulb with 67ºF wet bulb for cooling and 70ºF for heating.

### *Zone requirements:*


Since a Daikin Model MHC 009 produces approximately 10,000 Btuh of cooling, it is not sufficient for this zone and a model MHC 012 should be considered. Model MHC is chosen because it is specifically designed for a boiler/tower application. Typical water flow rates for boiler/tower applications are 2.0 to 2.5 GPM per ton and in this example no antifreeze is used.

### *Selection:*



## *Final selection:* **MHC 012**

## *Extended range/geothermal applications:*

The following example illustrates the same zone in a geothermal application.

The load requirements for the zone are the same as the above example – 10,430 Btuh of total cooling and 6,950 Btuh of sensible cooling and 9,150 Btuh of heating. Geothermal loop software programs are available to help determine the size of the loop field based on:

Desired entering water temperatures for the system.

Specific acreage available for the loop which produces specific min./max loop temps for the unit selection.

Entering water temperatures for geothermal systems can be as high as 90º to 100ºF and as low as 30ºF based on the geographical location of the building. Water flow rates are typically 2.5 to 3 GPM per ton and the use of antifreeze is required in most northern applications.

### *Zone requirements:*


A Daikin Model MHW is chosen for this geothermal application. Model MHW offers insulated water piping for condensation considerations and a different freezestat setting to allow entering water temperatures lower than 40ºF (with antifreeze). Output capacities should be recalculated using the antifreeze reduction tables that are shown on ["Antifreeze correction factors" on page 37](#page-36-1). The Model MHW 012 is first considered but may not meet the heating load because of the reduced entering water temperatures (35ºF) and an antifreeze solution of 21% propylene (see [page 37\)](#page-36-1).

## *Selection:*

### **Model MHW 012 (extended range model)**


### *Final selection:* **MHW 012**

**Note:** In applications where the zone may be a corner office or have excessive glass area, the heating load could be greater than the heating output capacity of the MHC 012 model (say 7,800 Btuh). The choices are to upsize the unit to the next model available (015).

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Operating limits**

## **Air limits**

*Table 15: Air limits in °F (°C)*


# **Fluid limits**

*Table 16: Fluid limits*


**Notes:** 1. Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Geothermal range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.

2. This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.

# **Information for initial start-up**

# **Standard range units:**

Units are designed to start in an ambient of 50ºF (10ºC), with entering air at 50ºF (10ºC), with entering water at 70ºF (21ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

# **Geothermal range units:**

Geothermal range heat pump conditioners are designed to start in an ambient of 40ºF (5ºC), with entering air at 40ºF (5ºC), with entering water at 40ºF (5ºC), with both air and water at the flow rates used in the ISO 13256-1 rating test, for initial start-up in winter.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

# **Environment**

This equipment is designed for indoor installation only. Sheltered locations such as attics, garages, etc., generally will not provide sufficient protection against extremes in temperature and/or humidity, and equipment performance, reliability, and service life may be adversely affected.

## **Power supply**

A voltage variation of +/-10% of nameplate voltage is acceptable.

The T9000 Wireless Temperature Control is designed to provide precision temperature control without the installation labor and expense of wiring.

- Powered by AA batteries
- Mounts in any suitable location that will provide good temperature control.
- Large LCD display provides the user with current room temperature, set point temperature, time, program interval, and other system status information.

For detailed installation, operation refer to Operation & Maintenance Bulletin [OM 897](http://www.mcquaybiz.com/mcquaybiz/DocumentStorage/PTACUnits/InstallationandOperationManuals/OM_897-1.pdf).

**Programmable Non-programmable**

The second part of the T9000 system is called a Remote Control Node or "RCN". An RCN interfaces with specific desired HVAC equipment, and communicates with its thermostat using unlicensed 900 MHz, radio frequency energy. At the time of installation, the T9000 thermostat is linked to one or more RCN controls. The thermostat and RCN that have been linked will not interfere with, or be affected by, any other thermostat or RCN in adjacent rooms, apartments, or neighboring homes.
