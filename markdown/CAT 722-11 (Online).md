# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Overview**

# **The ThinLine Advantage**

New ThinLine vertical fan coils combine the features most desired in a fan coil by building owners, specifying engineers and contractors alike. The result is a new, third generation fan coil design that meets the needs of all three.

## **For building owners**

ThinLine fan coils offer quiet operation. They fully comply with [ASHRAE 62.1-2004](https://ashrae.org/) standards for high indoor air quality. And they offer a range of control options that can enhance occupant comfort and reduce operating costs. These units are also easy to maintain, with easy access to filters, fan motors and control systems. Heavier-gauge panels and locked control compartments for tamper-proof style cabinets are available. A total of five color options, both as standard and special requests are available for a variety of decor styles.

## **For specifying engineers**

ThinLine fan coils provide great versatility. A variety of vertical models are available with multiple arrangements and configurations.

- Coil options include two, three, and four-row main coils to provide precise heating and cooling performance for any requirement. Separate, single-row reheat coils (hot water or steam) are available. Separate, one-row or two-row preheat coils are also available with same or oppositeend coil connections.
- Multiple control options range from a simple fan speed switch to a low voltage interface board that can tie into most building automation systems. Non-communicating or communicating control options for LonTalk® and BACnet® will be available soon. Contact your Daikin representative for details.
- Grille options include stamped inlet and outlet grilles and multidirectional grilles. Aluminum fresh air boxes are also available.
- Appearance options include cabinet units with a durable, powder paint finish and decorative wall plate panels for hideaway units in Cupola White or Antique Ivory. Other colors such as Off White, Putty Beige and Soft Gray are available as specials. Custom colors can be matched as a special item. Leveling feet are available, as are rear cabinet extensions in 4 and 8-inch depths. Tamper- proof units are a selectable option, with 16-gauge steel panels, a return grille and key-operated, locking access doors.

## **For contractors**

For contractors, ThinLine fan coils feature Quick Ship options for fast delivery and a number of features that make installation fast and simple.

- Factory-mounted, wired and tested valve and piping packages for quick hookup to the building piping to reduce installation time. Packages can also be shipped loose with the unit for quick and easy field installation. Valve and piping packages are designed for enteringwater-temperature sampling. This eliminates the need for inefficient bleed lines to sense automatic changeover on two-pipe units.
- Factory-mounted and tested controls minimize field setup. Depending on the option requested, controls can be wired with a 24 VAC transformer to provide a singlesource power connection to the unit. Several options are available for unit or wall mounted thermostats and sensors. All wall-mounted thermostat and zone sensors require only low-voltage control wiring from the device to the unit control box.
- Easy, end-panel removal for hookup of electrical and piping connections minimizes field-labor time and cost.
- End compartment panels can be removed for installation and service without removing the front panel covering the fan blower section. This means that airflow through the filter and coil is not jeopardized for taking temperature and performance readings.
- Both the main drain pan and optional secondary drain pan are easily accessed for cleaning.
- The fan deck and motor assembly is easily removed when required for service.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Options and Accessories**

# **Control Options**

## **Manual 4-Position Fan Switch**

Several styles of the four-position fan switch (OFF, High, Med, Low) are available for unit-mount, remote- or wall-mount. The remote-mount option operates on low-voltage or line-voltage power and can be provided with a factory-

mounted, low-voltage interface board, which contains (3) 24-volt relays with line-voltage contactors and terminal connections. The transformer is factory-installed and wired. The unit-mounted option operates on line voltage.

## *Sequence of operation*

- *OFF:* Fan is turned OFF.
- *High, Medium, Low:* Fan runs continuously at the selected speed.

## **Analog Electronic Thermostat, Unit-Mounted**

The unit-mounted analog electronic thermostat option combines the three-position fan switch with an analog thermostat for room temperature control. It is compatible with two pipe or

four pipe fan coils and is available with automatic (MTB-155) or manual (MTA-155) changeover.

#### *Sequence of operation*

Fan Switch

- *OFF:* Fan is turned OFF. Thermostat is OFF. The ON/OFF motorized control valve, when supplied, is closed.
- *High, Medium, Low:* Fan runs continuously at the selected speed.

Thermostat

• Cycles the valve(s) open or closed on demand based on occupant-desired level.

Changeover:

- *Manual: The user selects whether the thermostat operates in heating or cooling mode. In heating mode the valve opens when the room temperature is below the set point. In cooling the valve opens when the room temperature is above the set point. A factory installed aquastat prevents valve operation if heating is selected when pipes contain chilled water or if cooling is selected when pipes contain hot water.*
- *Automatic: The thermostat automatically selects heating or cooling mode based on the temperature of the water in the pipes. A factory installed aquastat operates the valve in heating mode when the pipes contain hot water or cooling mode when pipes contain chilled water.*

## **MT155 Thermostat, Wall-Mounted**

The MT155 series thermostat provides ON-OFF control for lowvoltage or line-voltage valves and fan motors. It is remote- mounted. Options include manual or automatic changeover, two or four pipe fan coil control, with or without three speed control continuous fan

operation. This thermostat can be field-mounted on any vertical ThinLine fan coil unit equipped with a low voltage interface board, refer to Daikin publication [IM 1089.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)

This thermostat is capable of continuous fan operation and ON-OFF, normally closed valve control. The thermostat cycles the valves ON and OFF with demand. The fan runs continuously at the manually selected fan speed. When the system switch is in the OFF position, the fan is OFF and the valve is closed.

## **Digital Thermostats, Unit- and Wall-Mounted**

Daikin offers a broad range of unitmounted and remote, wall-mounted digital thermostats with the capability to control ON-OFF, 3-wire floating and proportional modulating actuator, and Normally-Closed or Normally-Open valves. See [Table 1](#page-7-1). For more information, refer to the Daikin publication [ED 18513-1](http://www.DaikinApplied.com) and Installation Manuals for the specific thermostat (also see [IM 980-1\)](http://www.DaikinApplied.com).

**MT158 and MT168 Thermostat-Controllers with Digital Display** 

Series MT158 and MT168

microprocessor-based thermostat controllers combine a proportional integral (PI) control algorithm with adaptive logic. They can be unitmounted or remote-wall mounted.

Heating and cooling outputs for the

MTB158 are individually configurable for three-wire floating point, ON/OFF normally open, or ON/OFF normally closed control valves.

6------------------------------------------------



Heating and cooling outputs for the MT168 provide 0-10 Vdc or 4-20 mA. An integrated, three-speed fan control switch is line-voltage capable to allow direct connection to the fan motors. A manual or automatic changeover is provided with remote setback capability from a time clock or facility management system. Features include a Fahrenheit or Celsius digital display and built-in purge cycling which assists the controller to determine if the system is supplying hot water or chilled water.

Standard control features constant fan operation with cycled or modulating valve operation. The fan runs continuously at the manually selected fan speed (High, Medium or Low). The controller modulates or cycles the valve with demand.

## **T170 and T180 Wall Mounted Thermostats**

Daikin offers four different wall mounted Digital Heating/ Cooling Thermostats with constant fan or Fan cycled, ON/OFF normally closed Valve Control. The nonprogrammable TA170 and TB170 and the seven day, four event programmable TA180 and TB180.

The TA170 and TA180 are configured for user selected fan speed control. The TB170 and TB180 are configured for staged fan speed control where the thermostat selects high, medium, or low based on the room temperature and set point differential. All four provide automatic and manual changeover, adjustable dead band, one two or three speed fan control, adjustable setback, condensate overflow alarm and on-off normally closed damper control. All can be used with line or low control voltage. The thermostat interface contains buttons for use in navigation to accompanying menus/screens and for performing specific operations. Detailed installation instructions and modes of operation can be found in [IM 1152.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)

## **Low-Voltage Interface Board or Terminal Strip**

A low-voltage interface board or terminal strip is used with any remote (wall mounted) Daikin thermostat or control. They can also be used in conjunction with a field-supplied controller of a building automation system (BAS) control where low voltage is needed to operate the fan coil. They are located in the control box for the unit (see [Figure 3](#page-6-0)).

The LV interface board or terminal strip include:

- Three 24-volt relays with line-voltage contactors to operate the fan motor speeds (LV interface board only).
- Terminal connections for interfacing to:
	- An optional remote-mounted thermostat.
	- Low-voltage actuators for heating and cooling valves.
	- A return air sensor.
	- A pipe temperature sensor for changeover from heating to cooling on two-pipe systems.

## **Unit Accessories**

## **Decorative Wall Plate Option**

Decorative wall plates have rounded corners for an attractive appearance. Wall plate can be selected as an accessory in a variety of colors with front or top discharge. Custom colors may be available, Contact your Daikin Applications Group with inquiries. For Dimensions, see [Figure 19 on page 30](#page-29-1).

## **Cabinet Color Options**

Exposed units are shipped in the standard color of Antique Ivory. Special colors include: Cupola White, Off White, Putty Beige and Soft Gray. For details of paint colors and finishes, refer to Daikin publication Form [2F-1188](http://www.DaikinApplied.com). Metal samples are available upon request.

## **Fresh Air Damper Options (Manual and Motorized)**

A fresh air intake damper that will provide up to 25% fresh air can be ordered either as factory-installed or as a fieldinstalled kit. The kit consists of an intake with damper blade and insect screen. The damper may be manually controlled through the return air opening or with an optional factory- or field-installed 24 V damper motor. If freezing air temperatures are expected, the damper must be closed or outside air must be tempered before entering the unit. A low-temperature sensor is recommended.

## **Fresh Air Intake Box Option**

Fabricated of aluminum with weep holes, the Fresh Air Intake Box has a double set of louvers in series to prevent moisture draw-through. This is used with a fresh air damper and is mounted in an exterior wall. For Dimensions, see [Figure 20 on page 30.](#page-29-2)

## **Condensate Overflow Switch Option**

With proper mounting, the condensate overflow switch will detect water collecting in the primary drain pan before an overflow can occur. This is a N.C. low voltage switch that opens when water levels rise and closes when water is no longer present. The switch should be field-wired to a controller to facilitate the fan and/or control valve shut-down when condensate starts collecting in the drain pan.

## **Tamperproof Cabinet Option**

This option can be factoryor field-installed on cabinet units to prevent access to unit controls and unauthorized removal of cabinet panels. It includes a key lock access door to unit controls and torx head screws for cabinet panels. Stamped grille for return air is standard with tamper-proof models.

**Return Air Grille** A stamped-steel return air grilles are available as factory- or field-installed options. This option is standard with tamperproof models.

9------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-9-0"></span>## **Leveling Legs Option**

Field- or factory-installed kits are available with 0" to 1" adjustment for positive leveling of floor-mounted units.

## **Extended End Pockets and Raised Subbases**

Standard end pockets on Daikin units can accommodate most installation requirements. Therefore, extended pockets are seldom needed. However, units with 4" or 8" extensions on one or both sides of the unit are available. As a rule, a total extension of 8" is only possible. The extended end pockets are used for applications with field-installed valve piping packages or controls by others when extra space is needed. They can also be used for remodeling or replacement projects to hide floor covering terminations.

**NOTE:** When extended end pockets are used, a standard rear cabinet extension may not be usable. Call your Daikin Sales Representative for suggestions.

Raised sub-base options are also available. Contact your Daikin Sales representative for details.

## **Rear Cabinet Extension Option**

This kit is available for applications where additional depth is needed. This kit is not designed to be an air duct or outside air plenum. 4" or 8" extension kits are standard. Other extension depths are available as a special request. Contact your Daikin representative for details.

Some common applications for the rear cabinet extension include:

- Additional depth for unit appearance
- Additional clearance for cross-over piping and connections
- Extend the discharge grille past drapery or wall hangings
- Hide floor covering terminations in remodeling projects
- Piping entry through the side panels of the unit
- **NOTE:** When extended end pockets are used, a standard rear cabinet extension may not be usable. Call Daikin Applications Group for suggestions.

10------------------------------------------------



# **Factory Valve & Piping Packages**

Factory valve and piping packages are available for both two-pipe and four-pipe systems with either right or left hand connections. Four-pipe systems can be configured with the heating and cooling connections on the same or opposite sides of the unit. Packages can be either factory-installed or factory-assembled and shipped loose with the unit. Units are also available without valve and piping packages in either a right-hand or left-hand configurations. All packages are fully leak tested.

Factory-installed packages are sweated to the coil and wired to the unit control box or LV Interface Board. Chilled and hot water pipes are the only field connections required. Piping is 1/2" nominal copper (5/8" OD).

Pre-determined field connection points are located for easy access. See [Figure 12 on page 14](#page-13-0) for connection locations. The installing contractor can pre-pipe the building water connections before the units arrive on the jobsite. A label clearly identifies chilled and hot water connection points on every unit.

All chilled water piping and components are located to allow condensate to drain into the secondary drain pan supplied with the valve package. Insulation of the factory piping package is not required.

## **Available Packages**

Numerous piping packages are available to match design configurations. Additional components can be added to meet exact requirements, including P/T ports, unions, and flexible stainless steel hoses.

## *Basic Packages*

Basic valve and piping packages add control valves to the Shut-Off Only package. All Daikin control valves are factorymounted in the supply water pipe. See [Control Valve Options](#page-12-0)  [on page 13](#page-12-0) for more information on the variety of control valves available.

#### *Figure 6: Basic Package*

**(See [Figure 11](#page-11-1) for components key)**

## *Enhanced Packages*

Enhanced valve and piping packages add a strainer to the Basic package supply water pipe. The strainer is attached to the supply water pipe at the coil connections. The strainer body is cast brass construction with a stainless steel mesh that is easy to remove for cleaning.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>## *Premium Packages*

Premium valve and piping packages replace the Basic package a ball valve in the return line with a manual or automatic circuit setter. The manual circuit setter is also known as a manual flow control valve. The auto circuit setter acts as both a flow setting device and a shut-off valve. It allows water flow through the fan coil to be set quickly and accurately. The circuit setter includes a cartridge within the valve body that is sized to allow a specific flow rate through the coil without any action required by a system piping balancer.

P/T ports are included, which are used to measure the temperature or pressure drop across the valve. This pressure drop can be compared to factory supplied tables that relate the pressure drop to a specific flow rate. The manual circuit setter valve also has a memory stop so that the correct setting can be found quickly.

#### *Figure 8: Premium Package*

**(See [Figure 11](#page-11-1) for components key)**

#### *Figure 9: Bypass Bleed Line*

**NOTE:** A bypass bleed line is installed on all factory provided fan coil valve packages with a 2-way control valve to prevent stagnation of water near the changeover switch (aqua-stat)or changeover sensor (10K pipe sensor). The bleed line allows 3 – 4 gpm of flow to bypass the coil which is necessary for the proper function of the automatic changeover system. All valve packages, cooling and heating, with a 2-way control valve automatically include the bypass bleed line. If the bleed line is unwanted, it may be crimped by the installing contractor to prevent bypass flow.

## *Deluxe Packages*

Deluxe valve and piping packages add a strainer to the Premium package. The strainer is available with or without an optional draining (blow-off) valve.

#### *Figure 10: Deluxe Package*

**(See [Figure 11](#page-11-1) for components key)**

#### <span id="page-11-1"></span>*Figure 11: Components Key for Schematics*


**Note:** Daikin 3-way valves are equipped with a fixed balance orifice in the bypass line, eliminating the need for a separate balancing valve

12------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-12-0"></span>**Control Valve Options**

Except for Shut-off Only packages, all valve and piping packages include control valves for controlling water flow. All Daikin control valves are factory assembled and mounted in the supply water pipe downstream of the coil. Several options are available:

## **Two-Way/Two-Position Valves**

These valves will be either Fully-Open or Fully-Closed in response to a line voltage (115, 208-230 or 265-277 VAC) or 24 VAC signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. Some means of relieving pump head pressure should be applied when two-way valves are selected. Normally-Open or Normally-Closed valves are available, both spring-return type.

## **Three-Way Two-Position Valves**

These valves either allow full water flow through the coil or divert the flow through a bypass line. The valves respond to a line voltage (115, 203-230 or 265-277 VAC) or to 24 VAC signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. All standard three-way valves come with a fixed-balance orifice in a bypass line to compensate for flow balancing in the bypass position, eliminating the need for an additional balancing valve. Normally-Open or Normally-Closed valves are available.

## **Motor option**

Horizontal ThinLine fan coil units are equipped with standard three-tap Permanently-Split Capacitor (PCS) motors for 115/1/60, 208-230/1/60 and 277/1/60 volt applications. Optional brush-less DC Electronically Commutated Motors (ECMs) are available for the above voltage ranges. These motors are also used for high-static applications. All motors are connected to a unit-mounted electric panel with Quick-Connect fitting for ease of maintenance.

## **Two-Way Modulating Valves**

These valves modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. Standard Daikin modulating valves are three-wire floating point equal percentage valves. Zero to 10 VDC proportional valves are also available. The modulating valves are factory mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil.

## **Three-Way Modulating Valves**

These valves modulate water flow through a coil in response to a signal from a Daikin thermostat or controller. Three-way valves allow water that is directed through the coil to mix with water that is directed through the bypass line. This mixture exits through the leaving water pipe. Modulating valves are three-wire, floating-point equal percentage valves or 0-10 VDC proportional. The modulating valves are factory mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil.

## **Selecting Correct Size Modulating Valves**

Daikin Tools™ software automatically selects the best modulating valve size for the unit and coil being considered. By combining the [AHRI](http://www.ahrinet.org/site/1/Home) performance data, the coil flow rate and the DP across the water coil, the water coil Cv is calculated and the best matching modulating port size is selected. Valve and piping packages can easily be configured and automatically selected using Daikin Tools™.

## **Factory-Installed Valve and Piping Packages**

**NOTE: Deluxe valve packages are shown.** All valve packages, regardless of components included, have the similar hookup locations. Left hand connections are shown here. Right hand connection distances are the same. Distances to connections are from the chassis-side panel (visible panel face on the end), back of the unit, and top of lateral/end subbases (which has 3.1" of height, not considering height extensions). Dimensions may vary slightly from given values.

<span id="page-17-0"></span># **Unit Selection**

To achieve an efficient fan coil system, accurate system design and proper equipment selection is necessary. Variations, limitations/control of fan coil systems, design conditions and design load calculations are not described in detail in this catalog. More detailed information may be found in the [ASHRAE](https://ashrae.org/) Guide. This catalog contains AHRI-certified ratings and application ratings for ThinLine fan coil units from which a design engineer can make initial unit selections to meet system requirements.

A mechanical system designer must select the unit types best suited to the overall system before the actual unit sizes can be determined. The factors that generally influence this decision are: intended building usage, building layout, architectural and aesthetic values, economics, geographical location, and type of maintenance service available. The general results may be a mixture of unit types within a given system. Daikin manufactures fan coil units to meet many needs including ThinLine, HiLine™ and Large Capacity models. For Daikin product information, please go to [www.DaikinApplied.com.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)

## **Basic design data**

Prior to selecting individual unit sizes, a design engineer must fix or determine the following factors:

- Inside and outside wet and dry bulb design temperatures
- Total and sensible heat gains and losses of the area to be served
- Ventilation air
- Properties of the heating and cooling medium
- Available electric power service
- Any special design requirements of the building or system

## **Unit Size**

The capacity ratings presented in this catalog are provided for initial unit selection only. Water cooling and heating capacities, unit air flow, static pressure and glycol solutions are all incorporated into the program to provide the best possible selection. Consult your Daikin representative for a selection tailored to specific applications.

Unit sizes for the ideal system should be selected by calculating peak load requirements due to unusually high occupancy or severe climatic conditions and with fans operating at high speed. Ordinary day-to-day cooling and heating requirements are then achieved at low and medium speeds.

The initial unit selection should be checked for air volume in the design system and the cooling capacities checked against actual operating conditions. While units selected on the basis of sensible load will generally meet the total cooling load, total load should be checked in all cases.

The unit size is generally selected on the basis of matching the sensible cooling capacity of the unit with the calculated requirements when operating at high speed.

## **Coil Types**

Standard coils are designed to meet both cooling and heating requirements in a typical system. Two additional levels of enhanced primary coils are available to meet the total and sensible requirements of any application.

Heating requirements for two-pipe systems are generally met by employing the same water flow rate as cooling and adjusting the entering hot water temperature to obtain a matching unit heat output at low fan speed.

Four-pipe systems are generally designed by specifying the flow rate through the separate heating coil to meet the required heat load with the fan operating at the desired fan speed. Daikin offers two coil options for preheat and one option for reheat.

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Four-Pipe Systems - Steam Preheat or Reheat**

All performance measured on high speed tap, 115 V, zero ESP, with a throwaway filter. Medium and low-speed capacities are approximately 88% and 68% respectively of the high-speed capacity.

#### MBh (kW)

Q/ITD = Saturated steam temp – Entering air temp

To determine heating capacities at different entering steam pressure or entering air temperature, compute the new Inlet Temperature Differential (ITD) and multiply it by the Q/ ITD shown. See [Table 7](#page-20-1) to determine the saturated steam temperatures at various entering steam pressures. For more accurate values, use Daikin Tools™ selection program available from your Daikin representative.

MCA (Minimum Circuit Ampacity), MOP (Maximum Overcurrent Protection) or MFS (Maximum Fuze Size) Calculations

The minimum circuit ampacity (MCA) is the minimum wire size required for a field-wired product. The maximum overcurrent protection (MOP), or maximum fuse size (MFS) is the maximum fuse or circuit breaker size required to properly protect the equipment.

Select a standard fuse size or HACR type circuit breaker equal to the MOP. Standard Fuse Sizes are: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60 amps. Use the next larger standard size if the MOP does not equal a standard size. See Table 8 through Table 10 for motor FLAs.

HACR (Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration) type circuit breakers are required in the branch circuit wiring for all fan coils with electric heat.

**NOTE:** MCA and MOP ratings are based on the unit and electric heat power supply having the same voltage. If the electric heat power supply is different, a separate circuit breaker may be required. Follow local codes.

Heater Amps = (Heater kW × 1000) Heater Voltage

- **NOTE:** Use 120V heater voltage for 115V units. Use 240V heater voltage for 230V units.
- MCA = 1.25 × (heater amps + all motor FLAs)
- MOP or MFS = (2.25 x Largest Motor FLA) + Second Motor FLA + Heater Amps [If Applicable]

Sensing range shall be 0 to 158°F with a resolution of 1°F and an accuracy of +/- 1.5°F Maximum Total Error.
- 7. Binary Inputs. 2 total (Freeze Fault Detection, Occupancy Sensor)

The Freeze Fault Detection switch shall be sourced with 24VAC or DC, +/-20%. The binary input detection circuit shall be desighned such that a minimum of 7mA current flows through the external contacts. Unoccupied Mode: this binary input will detect the presence of an earth-grounded signal, which is supplied by an external, remote set of contacts.

- C. Binary Outputs: 9 total (Fan Low Speed, Fan Medium Speed, Fan High Speed, Valve Output #1, Valve Output #2, Valve Output #3, or Electric Heat Stage 1, Valve Output #4 or Electric Heat Stage 2, 2 Position Damper, Room Sensor Status LED).
	- 1. Fan Speed Outputs -There are three fan speed outputs on baseboard. If all three outputs are de-energized, the fan motor is off. Only a single type (low, medium, high) of speed output shall be turned on when fan operation is required.

Low Speed: this binary output is used to operate the fan at low speed. If this output is energized, the fan operates at low speed.

Medium Speed: this binary output is used to operate the fan at medium speed. If this output is energized, the fan operates at medium speed.

High Speed: this binary output is used to operate the fan at high speed. If this output is energized, the fan operates at high speed.

- 2. Two-Position Damper Output: Binary output may be used to open a fresh air ventilation damper. If the output is de-energized, the damper is closed. If the output is energized, the damper is open.
- 3. Room Sensor Status Output: Binary output may be used to energize and de-energize an indicator located on the room sensor. See Room Sensor Status Output Annunciation Table.
- D. Automatic Fan speed selection.
	- 1. When the fan mode/speed switch is in the "Auto" position and capacity is required, the fan speed is determined automatically based on the amount of error from the respective heating or cooling on setpoint. If the room temperature error exceeds 4°F (2.22°C), the fan will be "forced on" in the highest available fan speed. Once the room temperature error falls below 3°F (1.67°C), the fan will no longer be "forced on" in the highest available fan speed. If the "Highest Speed Force On" is not active the fan will start at low speed, and fan speed changes are determined by whether the room temperature is above or below the effective controlling on setpoint.
- E. Valve and Electric Heat Control
	- 1. The controller will be factory configurable for the following valve and electric heat control configurations.
