## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Low Operating Cost & Extended Operating Life**

This heat pump range is the result of careful design, aimed to optimize the energy efficiency of the unit, to reduce operating costs, and improve installation profitability, effectiveness, and economical management.

Trailblazer features high-efficiency scroll compressors, large condenser coil surface area for maximum heat transfer and low discharge pressure, continuous fan speed modulation, and a brazed plate evaporator with low refrigerant pressure drops.

## **Low Operating Sound Levels**

Low sound levels at both full-load and part-load conditions are achieved by the latest compressor design, a unique new fan that moves a large volume of air at exceptionally low sound levels, and the virtually vibration-free operation.

## **Outstanding Reliability**

The unit is equipped with hermetic orbiting scroll compressors, complete with motor over-temperature and over-current devices, and protection against excessive gas discharge temperature.

## **Superior Control Logic**

The new controller provides an easy-to-use control environment. The control logic is designed to provide maximum efficiency, continue operation in unusual operating conditions, and provide a history of unit operation. One of the greatest benefits is the easy interface with LonWorks, Bacnet, Ethernet TCP/IP, or Modbus communications.

## **Code Requirements**

### **Safety and Observance of Laws/ Directives**

Units are designed in accordance with applicable selections of the following:


## **Cabinet and Structure**

The cabinet is made of galvanized sheet steel and painted to resist corrosion, and the base frame has an eye hook to lift the unit for an easy installation. The weight is uniformly distributed along the profiles of the base, facilitating the arrangement of the unit.

### **Compressor**

The compressors are hermetic orbiting scroll compressors complete with motor over-temperature and over-current devices. An oil heater, which starts automatically, keeps the oil from being diluted by the refrigerant when the compressor stops. The compressors are connected in tandem on a single refrigerating circuit, fitted on rubber anti-vibration mounts, and complete with oil charge.

## **Refrigerant**

### **R-410A**

R-410A is promising for its efficiency, stability, and low environmental impact. R-410A offers a small swept volume, a good heat exchange capacity, and leads to reduced component sizes of items such as heat exchangers and tubing.

### **R-32**

R-32 is an a newer, more efficient alternative to R-410A. R-32 can be up to 12% more efficient than R-410A, and is easier to clean, reuse, recover, and reclaim. Its excellent performance in extreme hot or cold climates and 68% lower GWP (Global Warming Potential) make it an ideal choice for multiple-scroll chillers.

5------------------------------------------------



### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Evaporator**

The unit is equipped with a direct expansion plate-to-plate evaporator. This heat exchanger is made of stainless steel brazed plates and is covered with a 0.78 in. (20 mm) closedcell insulation material. The exchanger features an electric heater for protection against freezing, and is manufactured in accordance to PED standards.

### **Condenser**

The condenser is manufactured with internally enhanced seamless copper tubes, arranged in a staggered row pattern, and mechanically expanded into lanced and rippled aluminum condenser fins with full-fin collars. An integral sub-cooler circuit provides sub-cooling to effectively eliminate liquid flashing and increase cooling capacity without increasing the power input.

## **Condenser Fans**

The condenser fans are propeller type with high efficiency design blades to maximize performance. The blades are made of glass-reinforced resin, and each fan is protected by a guard. Fan motors are internally protected from over-temperature and are IP54.

## **Electronic Expansion Valve**

The unit is equipped with advanced electronic expansion valves (EEXV) to achieve precise control of refrigerant mass flow. As modern building automation systems require improved energy efficiency, tighter temperature control, and wider ranges of operating conditions, and incorporate features like remote monitoring and diagnostics, using electronic expansion valves becomes mandatory.

Electronic expansion valves possess unique features: short opening and closing time, high resolution, positive shut-off function to eliminate use of an additional solenoid valve, continuous modulation of mass flow without stress in the refrigerant circuit, and a corrosion-resistant stainless steel body.

Electronic expansion valves can be programmed to work with multiple other unit components, and increase performance and efficiency compared to those of a thermostatic expansion valve. The electronic expansion valve allows the system to work with low condenser pressure (during winter time) without any refrigerant flow problems, and with a perfect chilled leaving-water temperature control.

## **Refrigerant Circuit**

Each unit has one refrigerant circuit that includes:

- Compressors
- Refrigerant
- An evaporator
- An air-cooled condenser
- An electronic expansion valve
- Charging valves
- A high-pressure switch
- High-pressure transducers
- Low-pressure transducers
- A suction temperature sensor

6------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-6-0"></span>## **Electrical Control Panel**

Power and control are located in the main panel, manufactured to ensure protection against all weather conditions. The electrical panel is IP54 and (when opening the doors) internally protected against possible accidental contact with live parts. The main panel is fitted with a safety interlock switch door that shuts off power supply when opening.

### **Power Section**

The power section includes compressors and fan-protection devices, compressors and fan starters, and a control-circuit power supply.

### **Unit Controller**

The unit controller is installed as standard; it can be used to modify unit setpoints and check control parameters. A built-in display shows chiller operating status plus water temperatures, refrigerant, programmable values, and setpoints. A sophisticated software with predictive logic, the unit controller selects the most energy-efficient combination of compressors and EEXV to maximise chiller energy efficiency and reliability.

The unit controller is able to protect critical components based on external signs from its system (such as motor temperatures, and refrigerant gas and oil pressures). The input coming from the high-pressure switch cuts all digital output from the controller in less than 50ms, which is an additional security for the equipment.

A fast program cycle (200ms) allows for precise monitoring of the system. Floating point calculations are supported for increased accuracy in pressure/temperature conversions.

The unit controller's built-in terminal has the following features:

- 164x44 dot matrix liquid crystal display with white back lighting. Supports Unicode fonts for multilingual use
- A keypad with 3 keys
- Push'n'Roll control for increased usability
- Memory to protect data
- General fault alarm relays
- Alarm history memory to allow for easy fault analysis
- Password-protected settings
- Application security to prevent application tampering or hardware usability with third-party applications.
- Service reports displaying all running hours and general conditions

#### *Control Section Main Features*

The unit controller is able to communicate to BMS (Building Management System) based on the most common protocols such as:

- ModbusRTU
- LonWorks, now also based on the international 8040 Standard Chiller Profile and LonMark Technology
- BacNet BTP certified over IP and MS/TP (Class 4)
- Ethernet TCP/IP

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

#### **WARNING**

Installation and maintenance of the unit must be performed only by qualified personnel who have knowledge with local codes and regulations, and experience with this type of equipment.

Do not install the unit in a location where it could be considered dangerous to perform any maintenance operations.

## **Handling**

Care should be taken to avoid rough handling or shock. Do not push or pull the unit from anything other than the base frame. Do not allow the unit to fall during unloading or moving as this may result in serious damage. To lift the unit, rings are provided in the base frame of the unit. Spreader bar and cables should be arranged to prevent damage to the condenser coil or unit cabinet.

## **Location**

The unit is produced for outdoor installation on roofs, floors, or below-ground level on the condition that the area is free from obstacles for the passage of the condenser air. The unit should be positioned on solid foundations and perfectly leveled. In the case of installation on roofs or floors, it may be advisable to arrange the use of suitable weight distribution beams. When the unit is installed on the ground, it should have a concrete base at least 10 in. wider and longer than its footprint. Furthermore, this base should withstand the unit weight mentioned in the technical data table.

## **Acoustic Protection**

When the noise level must meet special requirements, it is necessary to pay the maximum attention to ensure the correct insulation of the unit from the support base by applying appropriate vibration-dampening devices on the unit, on the water pipes, and on the electrical connections.

## **Storage**

The environment conditions must be within the following limits:


### **Space Requirements**

It is important to respect the minimum distances which guarantee the best ventilation of the condenser coils. Limitations of space reducing the air flow could cause significant reductions in cooling capacity and an increase in electricity consumption.

Two conditions must be avoided to achieve the best performance: warm air recirculation and coil starvation. Both conditions cause an increase of condensing pressures, reducing unit efficiency and capacity. However, during abnormal conditions, the unique microprocessor is able to calculate the operating environment and the unit's capacity to optimize its performance staying on line.

Each side of the unit must be accessible after installation for periodic service. [Figure 7](#page-15-0) shows minimum recommended clearance requirements. If the units are positioned in locations surrounded by walls or obstacles of the same height as the units, the units should follow the minimum recommended clearance requirements shown in [Figure 8.](#page-15-1) In the event the obstacles are higher than the units, the minimum recommended clearance requirements are shown in [Figure 9](#page-16-0).

Units installed closer than the minimum recommended distance to a wall or other vertical riser may experience a combination of warm air recirculation and coil starvation, reducing unit capacity and efficiency. The microprocessor control is proactive in response "of design condition." In the case of single or compounded influences restricting airflow to the unit, the microprocessor will act to keep the compressor(s) running (at reduced capacity) rather than allowing a shut-off on high discharge pressure.

When two or more units are positioned side-by-side it is recommended that the condenser coils are at a minimum distance from one another as shown in [Figure 10](#page-16-1); strong wind could be the cause of air warm recirculation.

For other installation solutions, consult a Daikin Applied sales representative.

The above recommended information are representative of general installation. A specific evaluation should be done by a contractor depending on the case.

## **Chilled Water Systems**

The pipes must be designed with the lowest possible number of bends and vertical changes of direction. This means installation costs are reduced considerably and system performance is improved.

The water system must have:

- 1. Anti-vibrating pipes which reduce the transmission of vibrations to the structures.
- 2. Isolating valves to isolate the unit from the water system of the installation during service operations.
- 3. Manual or automatic air venting device at the system's highest point and a draining device at the system's lowest point.

- 4. Neither the evaporator nor the heat recovery device must be positioned at the system's highest point.
- 5. A suitable device that can maintain the water system under pressure.
- 6. Water temperature and pressure indicators to assist operators during service and maintenance.
- 7. A water filter or a device that can remove particles from the liquid and is mandatory at the entry of the evaporator.

The filter can be installed at the pump inlet when it is placed on the evaporator water inlet pipe but only if the cleanliness of the water installation between the pump and the evaporator is guaranteed. Any waste in the evaporator will void the unit guarantee.

- 8. If the unit is being replaced, empty and clean the entire water system before installing a new one. Prior to starting it, carry out adequate tests and chemical treatments of the water.
- 9. If glycol is added to the water system to provide antifreeze protection, the performance of the unit will decrease. All unit-protection systems, such as antifreeze, and low-pressure protection will need to be readjusted to offset the low pressure.
- 10. Before insulating water piping, check that there are no leaks.
- 11. Check that the pressure of the water does not exceed the design pressure of the water side heat exchangers and install a safety valve on the water pipe.
- 12. Fit a suitable expansion tank.

#### **CAUTION**

To avoid damage, install an inspectionable filter on the water pipes at the entry to the heat exchangers.

### **Pipe Insulation**

The complete water circuit, including all pipes, must be insulated to avoid condensate from forming and reducing cooling capacity. Protect water pipes from freezing during the winter (using for example a glycol solution or a heating cable).

### **Preparing and Checking the Water Circuit Connection**

The units have water inputs and outputs for connecting the heat pump to water circuit of the system. This circuit must be connected to the unit by an authorized technician and must comply with all local, state, and national regulations on the subject.

#### *NOTICE*

The components listed below are not included with the unit, but are supplied upon request, also the event their installation is compulsory.

#### **CAUTION**

If dirt penetrates the water circuit, there could be problems. Therefore always remember the following when connecting the water circuit:

Only use pipes that are clean inside.

Keep the end of the pipe facing downward when removing any burrs.

Cover the end of the pipe when inserting it through a wall to avoid dust and dirt getting in.

Clean the pipes of the system located between the filter and the unit, with running water, before connecting it to the system.

#### *Figure 6: Water Circuit Connections*


The water in the system must be particularly clean and all traces of oil and rust must be removed. Fit a mechanical filter at the entry of every heat exchanger. Failure to install a mechanical filter can allow solid particles and/or welding burrs to get inside the exchanger. We recommend installing a filter with a filtering mesh with holes not larger than 0.04 in. (1.1mm) in diameter.

The manufacturer cannot be held responsible for any damage to the exchangers if the mechanical filters are not installed.
