# OVERVIEW

# LOW PRESSURE REFRIGERANT & OIL-FREE **MAGNETIC BEARING TECHNOLOGY**

The HVAC industry's next generation of water-cooled centrifugal chillers has arrived with the Daikin Applied Magnitude® WMT chiller; incorporating a two-stage centrifugal compressor and unit-mounted variable frequency drive (VFD) with **oil-free, magnetic bearing technology**. WMT's advanced compressor improves performance and decreases electrical requirements for up to **40% more energy savings** than traditional fixed-speed centrifugal chillers. Utilizing real-time sensors and fewer moving components, the digital bearing control system maintains perfect compressor shaft alignment to produce superior performance and dependable, long-life operation.

Direct-drive technology and an optimized compressor-refrigerant combination are incorporated with highly efficient heat exchangers to further maximize performance for a fully configurable design. The result? **WMT is the only chiller on the market to utilize a two-stage, oil-free compressor with R-1233zd(E) refrigerant**. It also offers the **smallest footprint and unit volume in the industry** compared to similar capacity magnetic bearing centrifugal chillers using R-1233zd(E). These capabilities are available for the entire capacity limits of WMT, ranging from 350 to 600 tons (1200 to 2200 kW) at standard AHRI conditions.

## Environmentally Friendly

As we become more aware of the environmental impact of their energy consumption and look for ways to reduce carbon footprint, the demand for electric HVAC systems has grown. Magnetic-bearing, electric HVAC chillers like WMT produce **lower emissions** compared to traditional centrifugal chillers, making them an attractive option for building owners and facility managers looking to **reduce carbonization**. No lubrication (oil) is used, which minimizes the risk of pollution from lubricant leaks or spills. Magnetic bearing technology also reduces mechanical wear and tear, yielding increased reliability and equipment longevity, which in turn lowers landfill impact associated with production and disposal of equipment.

OVERVIEW


## Low GWP Refrigerant

WMT is designed around R-1233zd(E) – an ultra-low GWP next generation refrigerant for low pressure machines. It has a GWP value of just 1 and an A1 safety group classification, yielding the lowest flammability and toxicity scores possible. This, combined with being a **highly efficient refrigerant,** makes R-1233zd(E) a long-term, sustainable solution. By adopting this refrigerant, WMT directly contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, lowering the impact on climate change. Building owners often wish to pursue Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Certificationn.Enhanced Refrigerant Management (formerly EA Credit 4) qualification is partially determined by tonnage and refrigerant quantity, which allows WMT chillers to be **LEED certified**.

### Industry-Leading Performance Industry-Leading Performance

As the first HVAC manufacturer to bring magnetic bearing chiller technology to market, Daikin Applied Magnitude chillers have led the industry; boasting a nearly 40% greater efficiency over traditional oiled centrifugals. The new WMT chiller offers the **best performance in the market** – capable of 0.48 kW/ton full load efficiency and 0.30 kW/ton part load IPLV. This is in part thanks to WMT's **wide operational envelope** – enabling the chiller to produce high evaporator leaving water temperatures up to 80°F, high condenser leaving water temperatures up to 119°F, low condenser entering water temperatures down to 40°F and operation **down to 10% capacity** without the need for hot gas bypass.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

## Quiet Full-Load Capacity

Sound pressure levels (SPLA) as low as 79 dB(A) at full load capacity in accordance with AHRI Standard 575 means **minimal noise distractions**. WMT achieves even quieter operation at reduced loads and non-standard conditions. Schedule a personal visit at the factory to see your own chiller's operation, performance and sound testing, or opt for a convenient remote/non-witness test.

## Compact Footprint

The compact size of a Magnitude WMT chiller is ideal for both new and replacement installations. It's a perfect fit when looking to maximize usable space while minimizing installation costs. WMT provides the **smallest footprint and unit volume in the market** among similar capacity R-1233zd(E) magnetic bearing chillers – optimizing floorspace and minimizing installation costs that are critical to customers.

## Knockdown Disassembly

WMT chillers can also accommodate more challenging access projects using a factory, **knock-down disassembly option**, with various package options during transportation and installation of the unit. Knockdown disassembly means that the unit can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces that make it easier to transport to the installation site. Additionally, it can also make it easier to maneuver the unit into tight or difficult-to-reach spaces, reducing the overall installation time and effort. This can be particularly beneficial in retrofit or renovation projects where space constraints may be a concern.

# ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

# Maximum Uptime

Quiet Full-Load Capacity

Power failures can turn into a critical loss of cooling in mission critical facilities such as data centers, hospitals or manufacturing buildings. These applications call for stringent capabilities for chillers to restart or resume operation quickly. WMT offers the **best uptime capabilities in the industry** and has low inrush current at startup, ideal for operation with backup or emergency power systems. Other chillers may require adding expensive thermal storage tanks, but WMT simplifies ownership thanks to RideThrough® and RapidRestore®. Combine this with WMT's operation down to 10% capacity without hot gas bypass, and facility managers can breathe easier with decreased disruptions to vital services.

# **RIDETHROUGH®**

WMT chillers feature Daikin Applied's unique power trip resilience technology called RideThrough, which **maintains operation, even during a power loss, for up to 10 seconds** – a feature that no other competitor is known to offer. This is most beneficial when a backup generator is on site, as it typically takes less than 10 seconds to turn on and provide power back to the unit. With RideThrough, when power goes out, the compressor motor maintains rotation and the VFD catches and resynchronizes with the spinning rotor. This allows the chiller to push straight through a short-term power loss and return to its pre-power loss capacity within seconds, without shutting down and rebooting. When the motor isn't drawing power, it serves as a generative power system, temporarily feeding the bearings and controls with energy.

# **RAPIDRESTORE®**

When power outage times exceed the RideThrough threshold, Magnitude WMT again has the best solution in the industry – RapidRestore. With RapidRestore, WMT surpasses other chillers' **quick startup and fast loading** abilities in record times. WMT can restart in as little as 30 seconds after power is restored and then restores 80% cooling capacity in less than 70 seconds.

### EQUIPMENT FOR PLANNED SITUATIONS

Forming a contingency plan in the event of an outage can help you quickly get operations back to normal and limit financial loss, and help you breathe easier when the unexpected happens. Selecting the right-sized equipment is just one part of the process. The best contingency plans start by assessing and understanding your financial risk, and then using this information to drive the rest of your plan. Our Rental Solutions experts can specify the supplemental cooling system required to support any situation you're experiencing.

- **• System maintenance**
- **• Building expansion**
- **• Server room heat generation**
- **• Seasonal/staff heat load swings**
- **• Contingency plans**

### STANDBY

Standby for critical applications and processes is another efficient use for temporary rental equipment. A temporary system is sometimes used to back up manufacturing and chemical processes, or when a hospital's required system redundancy has been reduced.

### SUPPLEMENTAL CAPACITY

When the demand of your facility or process exceeds your current system's capacity because of record-high temperatures or changes to cooling requirements, Daikin temporary rentals can be used to increase your heating or cooling output. By eliminating the need to purchase additional equipment that might be only used part of the year, you save on capital expenditures.
