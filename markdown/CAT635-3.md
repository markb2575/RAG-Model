<span id="page-2-0"></span># **Introduction**

The Trailblazer® family of air-cooled scroll chillers continues the Daikin Applied legacy of high quality, high efficiency, latest technology and quiet operation. These features make the Trailblazer family the best overall value in air-cooled packaged chillers available today.

#### **Efficient Operation** 2F-4056 (10/24) ©2024 Daikin Applied

The Trailblazer units utilize environmentally acceptable R-32 refrigerant and meet the performance requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 for efficiency. Excellent part-load performance is achieved with four or six scroll compressors. A variable speed condenser fan option is also available to provide even higher part load efficiency. High overall efficiency = lower annual energy costs.

### **RapidRestore® and Fast Loading**

When power has been interrupted, the Trailblazer has the capability to restore cooling quickly by using RapidRestore and Fast Loading. These options make Trailblazer ideal for mission critical buildings, data centers, healthcare facilities, and manufacturing processes. Once power is restored after a power loss, the chiller will load approximately four times faster with RapidRestore than during normal operation.

## **Quiet Operation**

The Trailblazer units live up to the Daikin Applied reputation for low operating sound levels and make these chillers "neighborhood friendly." Full load sound pressure levels as low as 60 dB without insulation.

### **LEED® Points**

For building owners who wish to pursue Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Certification, points earned for Optimize Energy Performance (formerly EA Credit 1) are awarded based on overall building efficiency. The high efficiency of the AGZ-F will contribute to the total points earned for this credit. Trailblazer chillers can also contribute to Enhanced Refrigerant Management (formerly EA Credit 4) qualification which is partially determined by tonnage and refrigerant quantity. Consult with your Daikin Applied sales representative for more information.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Features and Benefits**

## **Nomenclature**


## **Unit Design Features**

Daikin Trailblazer air-cooled chillers are a product of our commitment to offer quiet, reliable, energy efficient equipment, incorporating high quality compressors, and innovative packaging.

### **Construction**

Trailblazer chillers are factory-assembled and mounted on a heavy-gauge steel base. The base distributes the unit weight for roof loading. Their small footprint allows smaller mounting pads or support structures and is a plus for retrofit or replacement applications.

### **Protective Coil and Base Guards**

Factory-installed wire grille guards surround the coils and base to provide protection for ground-level installations as standard.

### **Compressors**

Reliable hermetic scroll compressors with cast iron scrolls and three Teflon® impregnated bearings are used on the Trailblazer chillers to promote longevity.

Each model has the ability to modulate its capacity. Models with four compressors will have four steps of capacity modulation while models with six compressors will have six steps. Compressors stage on depending on the load of the system. This results in excellent part-load efficiency and reduced annual operating costs.

#### *Figure 1: Scroll Compressors*

### **Evaporator**

Trailblazer units are designed to maximize efficiency in the smallest possible footprint. The evaporator is a compact, high efficiency, dual circuit, brazed plate-to-plate type heat exchanger consisting of parallel stainless steel plates. These heat exchangers provide excellent heat exchange efficiency in a compact footprint and are especially attractive for smaller capacity units. Evaporators are designed and constructed according to, and listed by, Underwriters Laboratories (UL).

#### *Figure 2: Brazed-Plate Evaporator*

4------------------------------------------------



### **Condenser Coils**

Condenser coils are all aluminum alloy microchannel design with a series of flat tubes containing multiple, parallel flow microchannels layered between the refrigerant manifold piping. See ["Condenser Coils" on page 10](#page-9-1) for discussion of environmental factors related to material and coating options.

*Figure 3: Microchannel Coil*

### **Optional High Efficiency Variable Speed Condenser Fans**

The MicroTech® chiller controller uses ECM fan technology with an integrated inverter to optimize chiller efficiency and maintain proper head pressure. This feature improves part load efficiency substantially and offers the ability to operate in low ambient conditions down to -4°F.

All High Efficiency Trailblazer models also include a sound reduction mode to allow for reduced-sound operation.

#### *Figure 4: High Efficiency Variable Speed Condenser Fans*

### **Control System**

The MicroTech advanced chiller controller surpasses all other microprocessor-based chiller control systems available today. This powerful, user-friendly control system provides the flexibility and performance needed for either stand-alone unit operation or the controller can be easily tied into the building automation system of choice using the Daikin open protocol feature.

*Figure 5: MicroTech Unit Controller*

The open protocol platform allows you to choose from open standard protocols, such as BACnet® and Modbus® to communicate easily with the building automation system that best meets the facility requirements. These optional communications modules are available factory installed or can be easily field installed.

The MicroTech controller's design will not only permit the chiller to run more efficiently, but will also simplify troubleshooting if a system failure occurs. Every MicroTech® chiller controller is programmed and tested prior to shipment to help provide a trouble-free start-up.

### **Replaceable Core Filter Drier**

Factory-installed filter drier with a replaceable core allows for fast replacement of filter element and easier serviceability.

### **Optional Remote Evaporators**

Units with the optional remote evaporator will have the evaporator shipped separately for field mounting and piping to the outdoor unit.

### <span id="page-5-1"></span>**Optional Pump Package**

The on-board, integrated chilled water pump package provides important benefits:

- Simplifies the chilled water system design and installation
- Provides installation savings by reducing field piping, wiring and control costs
- Saves valuable floor space inside the building.
- Reduces project engineering content
- <span id="page-5-0"></span>• Greatly reduces pump operating costs with the variable flow pump VFD

#### *Figure 6: Optional Pumps Package Components*

#### *Standard Components*

**Single Pump:** Single spring inside seal, vertical, in-line, radially split-case pump, serviceable without breaking pipe connections. The motor and pump rotating assembly can be serviced without removing the pump casing from the line.

**Dual Pumps in a Single Casting:** Single spring insideseal vertical, in-line, radially split-case pumps, mounted in a common casing with a common inlet connection and outlet connection and including a flapper valve to prevent recirculation when only one pump is operating. The pumps are designed for duty/standby, not parallel operation. All information and performance curves for the single pump arrangement (Model 4380) can be used for the dual pump arrangement (Model 4372 and 4362).

The package is also is equipped with:

- "Y" type inlet strainer
- combination triple-duty outlet valve containing:
	- discharge shutoff valve
	- check valve
	- flow throttling valve
- combination suction guide with flow stabilizing outlet vanes and stainless steel strainer with a disposable finemesh start-up strainer
- mounted and wired flow switch
- factory power and control wiring
- interconnecting piping and insulation of all cold surfaces

Various tank and connection options are available for field mounting. Refer to the schematic in [Figure 6](#page-5-0) for more information.

### *Variable Flow VFD*

The operating cost savings resulting from using variable chilled water flow via a pump VFD is well known. In the past, however, its usage has been somewhat limited by the cost and uncertainty of field installing the required system pressure differential sensors.

Daikin Applied can now offer flow control through the pump VFD without the need for external pressure sensors. In addition to the sensorless operation, there are three other selectable operating modes:

**BAS Input:** The pump speed and system flow will be controlled from a customer-supplied BAS input signal.

**Remote Sensor Control:** The VFD is wired to a pressure sensor mounted in the chilled water piping system. This is the standard VFD control when a sensorless VFD is not used.

**Locally Selected Constant Speed Control:** Provides manual control of the pump speed, overriding any current automatic speed control.

Consult the current version of the installation manual for additional detailed information, which is available from your local Daikin Applied sales office or on [www.DaikinApplied.com.](www.DaikinApplied.com)

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

## **Operating and Standby Limits**

#### *Table 1: Operating Limits*


## **Unit Placement**

Trailblazer units are for outdoor applications and can be mounted either on a roof or at ground level. For roof mounted applications, install the unit on a steel channel or I-beam frame to support the unit above the roof. For ground level applications, install the unit on a substantial base that will not settle. Use a one-piece concrete slab with footings extended below the frost line. Be sure the foundation is level within 0.5" (13 mm) over its length and width. The foundation must be strong enough to support the unit weight.

## **Service Clearance**

#### *Figure 7: Service Clearance*

#### *Table 2: Service Clearance*


## **Operational Spacing Requirements**

Sufficient clearance must be maintained between the unit and adjacent walls or other units to allow the required unit air flow to reach the coils. Failure to do so will result in a capacity reduction and an increase in power consumption. No obstructions are allowed above the unit at any height. The clearance requirements shown are a general guideline and cannot account for all scenarios. Such factors as prevailing winds, additional equipment within the space, design outdoor air temperature, and numerous other factors may require more clearance than what is shown. Additional clearances may be required under certain circumstances.

## **Chilled Water Piping**

All evaporators and condensers have OGS-type grooved water connections (adhering to Standard AWWA C606). The installing contractor must provide matching mechanical connections. Be sure that water inlet and outlet connections match certified drawings and nozzle markings.

### *NOTICE*

PVC piping should not be used.

#### **WARNING**

Polyolester Oil, commonly known as POE oil is a synthetic oil used in many refrigeration systems, and is present in this Daikin product. POE oil, if ever in contact with PVC/CPVC, will coat the inside wall of PVC/CPVC pipe causing environmental stress fractures.

### **CAUTION**

<span id="page-7-0"></span>To prevent damage to the evaporator and potential chiller failure, a supply strainer is required in the inlet water piping which connects to this evaporator. This strainer must be installed prior to operation of the chilled liquid pumps.

Field installed water piping to the chiller **must** include:

- A cleanable strainer installed at the water inlet to the evaporator to remove debris and impurities before they reach the evaporator. Install cleanable strainer within 5 feet (1500 mm) of pipe length from the evaporator inlet connection and downstream of any welded connections (no welded connections between strainer and evaporator).
- Adequate piping support to eliminate weight and strain on the fittings and connections.
- A water flow switch must be installed in the horizontal piping of the supply (evaporator inlet) water line to avoid evaporator freeze-up under low or no flow conditions. The flow switch is supplied by the factory as an installed component or a field-installed kit shipped along with the unit. (See [page 11](#page-10-1) for more information.)

#### *NOTICE*

Units with the optional pump package include the strainer and flow switch.

- Piping for units with brazed-plate evaporators must have a drain and vent connection provided in the bottom of the lower connection pipe and to the top of the upper connection pipe respectively, see [Figure 8](#page-7-1). These evaporators do not have drain or vent connections due to their construction.
- Water pressure gauge connection taps and gauges at the inlet and outlet connections of the evaporator for measuring water pressure drop.

It is **recommended** that the field-installed water piping to the chiller include:

- Thermometers at the inlet and outlet connections of the evaporator.
- Vibration eliminators in both the supply and return water lines.
- Insulated chilled water piping to reduce heat loss and prevent condensation. For information on freeze protection, see ["Evaporator Insulation" on page 13.](#page-12-1)
- Isolation valves installed in the incoming and outgoing water piping to the evaporator.

### *NOTICE*

Failure to follow these measures may result in performance and reliability issues.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>#### *NOTICE*

Welded pipe connections are not allowed between the strainer and evaporator due to the chance of slag entering the evaporator. Evaporator may be oriented with connections on a different side than shown.

## **Inlet Strainer Guidelines**

An inlet water strainer kit **must** be installed in the chilled water piping before the evaporator inlet. Several paths are available to meet this requirement:

- 1. A factory installed option.
- 2. A field-installed kit shipped-loose with the unit that consists of:
- Y-type area strainer with 304 stainless steel perforated basket, Victaulic pipe connections and strainer cap.
- Extension pipe with two Schrader fittings that can be used for a pressure gauge and thermal dispersion flow switch. The pipe provides sufficient clearance from the evaporator for strainer basket removal.
- 0.5-inch blowdown valve
- Two grooved clamps

Both are sized and with the pressure drop shown in [Figure 9](#page-8-1).

3. A field-supplied strainer that meets specification and installation requirements of the current Installation, Operation and Maintenance Manual available at www.DaikinApplied.com.

#### <span id="page-8-1"></span><span id="page-8-0"></span>*Figure 9: Strainer Pressure Drop*

*Figure 10: Factory Installed Strainer* 

## **Water Flow Limitations**

### **Constant Flow**

The evaporator flow rates and pressure drops shown in [Figure](#page-8-1)  [9](#page-8-1) are for full load design purposes. The maximum flow rate and pressure drop is based on a 6°F temperature drop. Flow rates above the maximum values will result in unacceptable temperature and pressure drops and can cause excessive erosion, potentially leading to failure.

The minimum flow and pressure drop is based on a full load evaporator temperature drop of 16°F. Evaporator flow rates below the minimum values can result in laminar flow causing freeze-up problems, scaling and poor control.

### **Variable Flow**

Reducing evaporator flow in proportion to load can reduce system power consumption. The rate of flow change should be a maximum of 10 percent of the flow per minute. For example, if the maximum design flow is 200 gpm and it will be reduced to a flow of 140 gpm, the change in flow is 60 gpm. Ten percent of 200 gpm equals 20 gpm change per minute, or a minimum of three minutes to go from maximum to desired flow. The water flow through the evaporator must remain between the minimum and maximum values. If flow drops below the minimum allowable, large reductions in heat transfer can occur. If the flow exceeds the maximum rate, excessive pressure drop and tube erosion can occur.

## **System Water Volume Considerations**

All chilled water systems need adequate time to recognize a load change, respond to the change and stabilize to avoid undesirable short cycling of the compressors or loss of temperature control. In air conditioning systems, the potential for short cycling usually exists when the building load falls below the minimum chiller plant capacity or on close-coupled systems with very small water volumes. Some of the things the designer should consider when looking at water volume are the minimum cooling load, the minimum chiller plant capacity during the low load period and the desired cycle time for the compressors. Assuming that there are no sudden load changes and that the chiller plant has reasonable turndown, a rule of thumb of "gallons of water volume equal to two to three times the chilled water gpm flow rate" is often used. A storage tank may have to be added to the system to reach the recommended system volume.

## **Evaporator Freeze Protection**

Evaporator freeze-up can be a concern in the application of air-cooled water chillers in areas experiencing below freezing temperatures. To protect against freeze-up, insulation and an electric heater are furnished with the evaporator. AGZ-F chillers have an external plate heater and thermostat that helps protect the evaporator down to -20°F (-29°C) ambient air temperature. Although the evaporator is equipped with freeze protection, it does not protect water piping external to the unit or the evaporator itself if there is a power failure or heater burnout, or if the chiller does not directly control the chilled water pumps. Use one of the following recommendations for additional protection:

- 1. If the unit will not be operated during the winter, drain evaporator and chilled water piping and flush with glycol.
- 2. Add a year-round glycol solution to the chilled water system to provide freeze protection. Freeze point should be approximately 10°F(5.6°C) below minimum design ambient temperature or 10°F below the lowest design leaving water temperature, whichever is lower. The use of glycol anti-freeze is generally considered the safest

<span id="page-9-0"></span>protection against freeze-up, however, it will reduce the performance of the unit, depending the concentration. Take this into consideration during initial system design and selection. On glycol applications, a minimum fluid concentration should be based on Burst Protection limits.

- 3. The field installation of thermostatically controlled heat tracing and insulation to exposed piping. Factory insulation will have to be removed and replaced after installation of the tracing.
- 4. Continuous circulation of water through the chilled water piping and evaporator. (Dependent on power availability).

The evaporator heater cable or immersion heater is factory wired to the 115 volt circuit in the control box. This power should be supplied from a separate source to maximize unit protection, but it can be supplied from the control circuit. Operation of the heaters is automatic through the ambient sensing thermostat that energizes the evaporator heaters for protection against freezing. Unless the evaporator is drained in the winter or contains an adequate concentration of anti-freeze, the disconnect switch to the evaporator heater must be closed. Conversely, do not apply heat to the evaporator if it is drained.

### **High Ambient Operation**

Trailblazer units for high ambient operation (104°F to 125°F, 40°C to 52°C) require the addition of the optional high ambient package.

### <span id="page-9-2"></span>**Low Ambient Operation**

Compressor staging is adaptively determined by system load, ambient air temperature, and other inputs to the MicroTech® chiller control. The standard minimum ambient temperature is 32°F (0°C). A low ambient option allows operation down to -4°F (-20°C). The minimum ambient temperature is based on still conditions where the wind is not greater than 5 mph. Greater wind velocities will result in reduced discharge pressure, increasing the minimum operating ambient temperature. Field-installed louvers are available and recommended to help allow the chiller to operate effectively down to the ambient temperature for which it was designed.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>**Condenser Coils**

The standard coils on the Trailblazer chiller are an all aluminum alloy microchannel design with a series of flat tubes containing multiple, parallel flow microchannels layered between the refrigerant manifolds. The microchannel coils are designed to withstand 1000+ hour acidified synthetic sea water fog (SWAAT) test (ASTM G85-02) at 120°F (49°C) with 0% fin loss and develop no leaks. The all-aluminum microchannel coils provide superior longevity and durability for non-corrosive applications.



#### **NOTE:**

- 1. Non-corrosive environments may be estimated by the appearance of existing equipment in the immediate area where the chiller is to be placed.
- 2. Marine environments should take into consideration proximity to shore as well as prevailing wind direction.
- 3. Industrial contaminants may be general or localized, based on the immediate source of contamination (i.e. diesel fumes due to proximity to a loading dock).
- 4. Combined marine-industrial are influenced by proximity to shore, prevailing winds, general and local sources of contamination.

## **Epoxy coil coating**

Epoxy coil coating is a water-based, extremely flexible and durable epoxy polymer coating uniformly applied to all coil surfaces through a multi-step, submerged electrostatic coating process. Epoxy-coated condenser coils provide a 10,000+ hour salt spray resistance per ASTM B117-90. The epoxycoated coils also receive a UV-resistant urethane top-coat to provide superior resistance to degradation from direct sunlight. This coil coating option provides the best overall protection against corrosive marine, industrial or combined atmospheric contamination.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>## <span id="page-10-1"></span>**Water Flow Switch**

A factory-included thermal dispersion flow switch is necessary to avoid evaporator freeze-up under low or no flow conditions. A thermal dispersion flow switch will be factory-installed on package models.

On remote evaporator models, the flow switch will be shipped loose with the unit for field installation.

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**Options and Accessories**

### **RapidRestore and Fast Loading**

Allows the unit to restart and to reach full load more quickly than standard in case of a power interruption.

RapidRestore operation will allow for a faster time to full capacity while maintaining stable operation within each circuit.
