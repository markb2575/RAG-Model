10------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-10-1"></span>**Valve and Piping Packages**

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Valve and Piping Packages**

## **(For Field Installation Only)**

Three factory preassembled Valve & Piping packages for simple field installation are available for both two and four-pipe systems for either right or left-hand connections. Packages are shipped loose with the unit. 2-way or 3-way valves are available with line or low-voltage actuators.

- **Basic Package:** Interconnecting copper adapters and shutoff ball valves for supply and return lines, and control valve on supply water pipe complete with stainless steel flexible hoses.
- **Enhanced Package:** Enhanced valve and piping packages replace the ball valve on Basic package's leaving water pipe with a manual circuit setter (manual flow control valve). The circuit setter acts as both a flow-setting device and a shutoff valve, allowing water flow through the coil to be set quickly and accurately. The manual circuit setter includes P/T ports in the valve body. The ports are used to measure the temperature and pressure drop across the valve. This pressure drop can be compared to factory-supplied curves that relate the pressure to a specific flow rate. The valve also has a memory stop so that the correct setting can be found quickly
- **Deluxe package:** With Deluxe package, the customer receives the valves and piping of the Enhanced package, with the added value of automatic circuit-setter in lieu of a manual one and a strainer. The automatic circuit-setter includes a cartridge within the valve body that is sized to allow a specific flow rate through the coil without any action required by a system piping balancer. The auto circuit-setter is available on the leaving water pipe with a ball valve and includes 2 P/T plugs for pressure drop and temperature measurement through the valve. The strainer is attached to the entering water pipe at the coil connections.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>The achievement of an efficient fan coil system is dependent upon accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Variations, limitations and control of fan coil systems, design conditions and design load calculations are not described in detail in this catalog. More detailed information may be found in the ASHRAE Guide, from which the design engineer can mike initial unit selections to meet the requirements of the system.

The mechanical system designer must select the unit types best suited to the overall system before the actual unit sizes can be determined. The factors that generally influence this decision are: intended building usage, building layout, architectural and aesthetic values, economics, geographical location, and type of maintenance service available. The general results may be a mixture of various unit types within a given system. Daikin manufactures a fan coil unit to meet your every need including ThinLine™, HiLine™ and Large Capacity models. For Daikin product information. please visit www. DaikinApplied.com

### **Basic Design Data**

Prior to selecting the individual unit sizes. the design engineer must set or determine the following factors:

- Inside and outside wet and dry bulb design temperatures.
- Total and sensible heat gains and losses of the area to be served.
- Ventilation air.
- Properties of the heating and cooling medium.
- Available electric power service.
- Any special design requirements of the building or system.

### **Unit Size**

The capacity ratings presented in this catalog are provided for initial unit selection only. Water cooling and heating capacities, unit air flow, static pressure, and glycol solutions are all incorporated into the program to provide the best possible selection. Consult your Daikin representative for a selection tailored to your application.

Unit sizes for the ideal system should be selected by calculating the peak load requirements due to unusually high occupancy or severe climatic conditions and with fan operating at high speed. Ordinary day-to-day cooling and heating requirements are then achieved at low and medium speeds.

**Unit Selection** The initial unit selection should be checked for air volume in the design system, and the cooling capacities checked at the actual operating conditions. While units selected on the basis of sensible load will generally meet the total cooling load, total load should be checked in all cases.

The unit size is generally selected on the basis of matching the sensible cooling capacity of the unit with the calculated requirements when operating at high speed.

**Cooling Coil Requirements:** Having checked the minimum unit size to meet the ventilation requirement, the unit size is generally selected on the basis of matching the sensible cooling capacity of the unit at high speed to the calculated requirements.

The initial unit selection should be checked for air volume in the design system and the cooling capacities checked at the actual operating conditions. While units selected on the basis of sensible load will generally meet the total cooling load, total load should be checked in all cases.

**Water Coil Types:** 3-row and 6-row primary coils are available for all unit sizes to permit unit selections for optimum performance.

**Heating Requirements:** Heating requirements for two-pipe systems are generally met by employing the same water flow rate as cooling, and adjusting the entering hot water temperature to obtain a matching unit heat output at-low fan speed. Four-pipe systems are generally designed by specifying a design hot water temperature and adjusting the flow rate through the secondary heating coil to meet the required heat load with the fan operating at low speed.

For applications where outside air is ducted to the unit, the fresh air must be tempered before entering the unit if freezing conditions can be expected.

## **Computer Fan Coil Selection Program**

To provide optimal fan coil unit selection, Daikin provides Applied Systems Toolbox™ for computer fan coil selection software The computer program aids in the selection of the most economical unit size and coil option to meet the specification. The program capabilities include hot and chilled water, hot and chilled water with glycol, supplemental steam heat, and unit external static pressure. Use performance tables that follow for your initial rough estimates.

Contact your Daikin sales representative for selections specific to your applications.
