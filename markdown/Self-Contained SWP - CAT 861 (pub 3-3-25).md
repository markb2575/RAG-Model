### Low GWP Refrigerant

With a GWP of 675, R-32 contributes less to global warming potential compared to other refrigerants like R-410A. Because of R-32's excellent thermodynamic performance characteristics, an R-32 system could have up to 40% less charge than R-410A in certain applications, meaning you could reduce refrigerant usage in the equipment and potentially also reduce quantities leaking to the environment.

Being a pure, single-component refrigerant, R-32 can't lose its composition like a blended refrigerant and is well suited to retain its quality over time. It can be topped off and recharged in the field in both liquid and gas phases; because the composition doesn't change, it's easy to clean and reuse on site. R-32 can be reclaimed and recycled with a simple cleaning process, as compared to blends with less stable HFOs that must be distilled to their pure compounds and then remixed.

### Industry-Leading Performance

Industry-Leading Performance

The Daikin Applied vertical Self-contained system is an ideal option when energy efficiency, reliability, serviceability, indoor air quality and acoustics are important. These units produce **high Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) ratings that exceed AHRI 90.1 minimums by up to 35 percent**, so they consume significantly less energy while effectively conditioning the space.

Self-contained's compact footprint, configurable access/ piping and modular design with 34" deep sections allow for easy installation and adaptability to various mechanical rooms, while robust construction and serviceable design ensures durability and reduced maintenance costs.

Additionally, Daikin360 integrated service solutions provides comprehensive support and service options to help equipment end users maximize performance and longevity.

# MODULAR DESIGN FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RETROFIT PROJECTS

Self-Contained systems feature a conveniently small footprint that minimizes required HVAC mechanical space to install and maximizes usable space for architectural design. These complete packaged HVAC systems allow facility managers to customize every space within the building for distinct uses in order to create specific and better outcomes for occupants.

### One World Trade Center Manhattan, NY

166 Daikin Applied Self-Contained systems were chosen to meet the strict efficiency, indoor air quality (IAQ), and sound performance metrics required for One World Trade Center utilizing proven technologies:

- High pressure shell and tube condensers
- Variable speed, high performance fans
- Sound-reducing cabinetry and perforated liners
- Fully integrated factory controls
- High efficiency scroll compressors

### Levi's Stadium San Francisco, CA

Working with Daikin Applied to secure and install 21 high-efficiency Self-Contained systems and other energy saving measures, Levi's Stadium—home of the San Francisco 49ers—achieved LEED Gold Certification to become the first stadium to host a professional NFL team with that distinction.

Because of limitations of the area available to house the HVAC equipment, stadium engineers specified 100-ton Daikin Self-Contained systems to make better use of the available space.

#### EQUIPMENT FOR PLANNED SITUATIONS

Forming a contingency plan in the event of an outage can help you quickly get operations back to normal and limit financial loss, and help you breathe easier when the unexpected happens. Selecting the right-sized equipment is just one part of the process. The best contingency plans start by assessing and understanding your financial risk, and then using this information to drive the rest of your plan. Our Rental Solutions experts can specify the supplemental cooling system required to support any situation you're experiencing.

- **• System maintenance**
- **• Building expansion**
- **• Server room heat generation**
- **• Seasonal/staff heat load swings**
- **• Contingency plans**

#### SUPPLEMENTAL CAPACITY

When the demand of your facility or process exceeds your current system's capacity because of record-high temperatures or changes to cooling requirements, Daikin temporary rentals can be used to increase your heating or cooling output. By eliminating the need to purchase additional equipment that might be only used part of the year, you save on capital expenditures.

#### STANDBY

Standby for critical applications and processes is another efficient use for temporary rental equipment. A temporary system is sometimes used to back up manufacturing and chemical processes, or when a hospital's required system redundancy has been reduced.
