## **Introduction**

## **Daikin** *OptiLine* **Fan Coil Units**

The Daikin *OptiLine* fan coil air conditioning units are designed for use in multiple floor apartments, office buildings, hotels and other similar applications and require a minimum amount of floor space. Just one *OptiLine* unit may do the job that formerly required more than one conventional unit.

The results of many years of experience in the development, design and manufacture of fan coil air conditioners have been incorporated in the Daikin *OptiLine* units to provide highly efficient, quiet performance; individual thermostatic control; simple, low cost installation; application flexibility; and low maintenance and operating costs with no sacrifice in room comfort, design, or appearance.

For the ultimate in design, performance, efficiency, flexibility of application, and ease of installation and maintenance, look to Daikin *OptiLine* fan coils.

### **Application Flexibility**

Designs are available with the complete flexibility necessary for any application requirement.

• The 300 through 1200CFM draw-through configuration units are designed to meet individual room control requirements, or multiple discharge arrangement to serve more than one room.

Both designs are available for two-pipe and four-pipe systems with single, double, triple and top discharge arrangements. Optional equipment is available to provide complete application flexibility.

Contact your Daikin Representative for a copy of the Daikin Select Tools™ selection program to choose a unit meeting your needs.

### Amps = Watts

Volts

$$\text{Air temp. rise (Deßta T)} = \frac{\text{kW} \times \text{3160}}{\text{CFM}} = \frac{\text{MBH} \times \text{925}}{\text{CFM}}$$

$$\mathsf{S.A.} = \mathsf{Suspply } \mathsf{Air}$$

- FLA = Full Load Amps
- = S.A fan motor Amps + Electric Heater Amps
- MCA = Minimum Circuit Ampacity = FLA x 1.25
- MOP = Rating of maximum overcurrent protection device = (2.25 x S.A. fan motor Amps) + Electric Heater Amps

### **Requirements of Standards: UL 1995 and CSA C22.2 No.236**

- If the value of the calculated rating does not equal standard current rating of overcurrent protective device, the marked maximum rating shall be the next lower standard rating.
- Exception No. 1: The marked maximum rating of the overcurrent protective device shall be the standard rating next higher than the computed value if the next lower standard ratings is less than 125 percent of the current rating of an electric heater load, when the unit includes an electric heater.
- Exception No. 2: If the computed value of the overcurrent protective device is less than the minimum ampacity of the supply circuit, the marked rating of the device shall be increased to the largest standard overcurrent protective device rating appropriate for the marked minimum circuit ampacity.
- Exception No. 3: If the marked minimum circuit ampacity does not correspond to a standard protective device rating, the next higher standard rating of the protective device may be marked.

Sequence of installation by the contractor:

- A. If the drywall has not been installed flush with the outer edge of the collar on the unit and if the gap between the inner surface of the drywall and the outer edge of the collar exceeds 1/2", the opening will have to be sleeved.
- B. Insert the grille into the 1/2" deep collar on the fan coil unit so that the grille frame is against the drywall.
- C. Lift the hinged panel in the grille and secure the grille by fitting four sheet metal screws as shown above. Do not overtighten the screws as this might distort the grille frame and cause the hinged panel to be a loose fit in the retaining clips.
- D. Install the filter and close the access panel.

## **Riser Systems**

Insulated risers are available factory-installed or can be shipped with or prior to the units for field installation. Sweat ball valves are included with factory risers.

All copper risers are factory cut to a maximum 120" in length. Swaged connections for supply and return risers are standard. Insulation meets or exceeds current flammability classification UL94. Insulation to cover swaged couplings must be field provided.Supply and return risers are of type "L" copper in nominal ¾", 1", 1¼", 1½", 2", 2½" & 3" diameters with ½" to 2" factory installed, closed cell flexible foam insulation

- Drain risers are type "L" copper (insulation included), in nominal ¾" or 1¼" diameter
- Optional M or K type copper is available with closed cell insulation

**NOTE:** Insulation thickness is limited on larger risers on the small cabinet due to physical space available

The riser is a vertical pipe system, usually copper, that carries the supply, return (chilled and/or hot), and condensate water to and from a vertical stack fan coil unit.

Riser systems are installed in multi-story buildings where vertical stack hi-rise fan coil units are installed on top of each other, floor-by-floor. The risers interconnect the individual fan coil units as one moves from floor-to-floor, forming a "stack" as the risers ascend vertically through the building. Installation of the vertical stack fan coil unit is quick with no lateral runs of copper piping off the main riser lines.

Vertical stack fan coil units are available in both two-pipe and four-pipe systems. Two-pipe systems can provide chilled water only, or can be installed as a changeover system that switches seasonally from a chilled water system to a hot water system. Dedicated chilled water systems are common in warmer climates, but can be augmented with a dedicated electric heater. More temperate climates will use the changeover system when their cooler months will only require heating and their warmer months will only require cooling. Four-pipe systems provide both dedicated chilled water cooling and hot water heating. Both system types come equipped with an additional riser pipe to handle the condensate that is generated during cooling. A heating only two-pipe system can be selected without a condensate riser.

**Risers can be installed on any of the three free sides of the fan coil unit cabinet. The front of the unit is always defined by the location of the return air/access panel. Left, right, and back are all determined as if you were standing in front of the unit looking at the return air/access panel. In addition to the three primary riser orientations, a "reverse" version of each is available to aid in the elimination of cross-over piping when the unit locations change on the floor plans as one moves up through the building.**

Chilled water, hot water, and condensate risers are factory insulated to avoid condensation and/or heat loss. Factory insulation and installation of risers on the fan coil unit is standard and is recommended to minimize installation costs and to assure quality control of the insulation application. Insulation is available in a variety of materials (glass fiber, closed cell polyolefin foam, and closed cell elastomeric) and thicknesses (3/8ʺ thru 1ʺ), though not all material types are available in all sizes. Depending on region and climate, condensate riser insulation may or may not be necessary. Factory insulation is typically only fitted to the riser within the cabinet height as the ends of the riser should be accessible for connection to the units above/below. The exposed riser areas are then insulated in the field after installation and pressure testing.

It is important to consider the centerlines of the riser pipes when selecting insulation thickness. Some compression of riser insulation can occur, but in the case of a direct return system with two 3ʺ diameter risers side by side with 1ʺ of insulation, a 5ʺ spacing between center lines would be required, and not the 3¾ʺ that they are designed for.

## **Direct & Reverse Return**

There are two typical methods for designing and installing a riser stack; direct return and reverse return. Both offer their own advantages and disadvantages.

### **Direct Return**

### *Advantages*

- Cost-effective and simple
- Straightforward installation
- Less confusion about properly sizing the risers

### *Disadvantages*

• The pressure drop is not equal at each unit on the stack. The total pressure drop on the path that the water takes to the top floor is much greater than the path to the unit on the lower floor(s) near the main/pump. A means of balancing the water flows at each floor must be provided. If a means for balancing is not provided, it is possible that there will be no water flow through the upper units on the stack due to height and friction loss. Balancing is most often achieved by including a balancing valve on the return side of the coil piping package, either a manual balancing valve or an auto-flow balancing valve that is paired with a strainer on the coil supply side. Either option adds cost to the piping package in the unit.

### **Reverse Return**

### *Advantages*

- The system can be designed so that the total system pressure drop through each unit is automatically equalized.
- The overall pressure drop is lower offering the potential for energy savings.
- Fewer components in the piping package.
- Easier to accommodate larger riser pipe sizes and insulation thicknesses.
- Can eliminate the need for balancing valves and strainers.

### *Disadvantages*

- At least one additional "express" return main/riser is required to collect all of the return water from all the stacks back to the boiler/chiller.
- The design of the system is more complex/less intuitive.
	- Supply side risers start at the main with the largest size and decrease in size as they reach the end of the stack.
	- Return side risers start at the smallest size and increase in size as they reach the end of the stack.
	- This can make the reverse return riser difficult to understand; however, if the stack is "balanced" with an equal number of pipes of each size on each side of the stack it begins to make sense.
- **NOTE:** Some reverse return systems will employ an express return riser on each stack to take the return back to the mechanical room; however, this is very rare.

## **Riser Pipe Sizes**

### **NOTICE**

The design, selection of components, and specifications for a building's riser system are typically the Responsibility of the mechanical engineering company retained on a given project. This guide is to be used Solely as a guide document.

Copper pipe is used for risers. Job specifications will dictate the type of piping to be used. There are two types of copper available from Daikin, type L and type M; the difference between the two being the wall thickness of the copper pipe. For most applications either type is adequate. Condensate risers do not need to be type L and will be assumed type M unless advised otherwise.

Sizing the risers can be determined by totaling the sum of the flow required for all the units on the stack. By tracking the flow required in the stack as one ascends the building, the riser sizes should increase or decrease to accommodate the flow. The risers closest to the supply and return mains will be carrying the greatest amount of water and will be the largest, the risers furthest from the mains will carry the least amount of water and will be the smallest. Risers are available from ¾ʺ up to 3ʺ in diameter.

The tables on the following pages are the general guidelines for the pipe sizes that Daikin typically supplies for a riser system. There can be some variation of where the size transition should occur, +/- a few GPM. This is based on design criteria for frictional loss of 2 ft. per 100 ft. of pipe. Actual project velocity limits may be different than these based on the type of service, annual operating hours, or other guidelines as defined in the job specifications.

### **Direct Return**

- Assuming the main is at the bottom of the stack, the largest risers will be located at the bottom of the stack. As the water diverts out of the supply riser and into the unit, it is subtracted from the supply side volume and the risers decrease in diameter as they get further from the main.
- Since the water is returning down after the water goes through the unit, it flows back out into the return riser. The return riser then carries all the water of the units above it, and so the risers also decrease in diameter as they get further from the main.

### **Reverse Return Risers**

- Again assuming the main is at the bottom of the stack, the largest supply risers will be located at the bottom of the stack. As the water diverts out of the supply riser and into the unit, it is subtracted from the supply side, and the risers decrease in diameter as they get further from the main.
- Unlike the direct return, the return is being drawn up the stack, and therefore as the riser ascends the building it carries the water of all the units below, and it increases in diameter as they get further from the main.
- A reverse return riser system is "balanced" when the total number of pipes of a given size are the same on both the supply and return sides.
- **NOTE:** In both direct and reverse return risers, the whole system can be flipped with the mains located at the top.

### **Riser Capping**

Risers are typically capped at the end of the riser stack. Either top capped (TC) at the top, or bottom capped (BC) at the bottom. Direct returns are typically top capped for both supply and return with the bottoms connected to the main. Reverse returns have their returns capped at the bottom, and supply risers are capped at the top. Unless the mains are located at the opposite end of the building, then as above, flip your capping locations.

Riser drain valves, riser air vents, and riser balancing valves, if required, are typically supplied and installed by the contractor.

## **Riser Length**

Risers are coupled together using a swaged connection. The swage is the expanded portion at the top of the riser that allows for the insertion of the riser from above of the same nominal pipe size. Once inserted into the swage, the risers are soldered together. Do not use brazing as this will cause the pipe to overheat and damage the pipe insulation. It is critical to ensure that the horizontal run-out from each riser to the coil is centered in the slot in the cabinet and that the run-out from the riser is at 90° as it enters the cabinet prior to soldering the risers. If the run-out is not centered in the opening it can be damaged when the risers expand/contract.

The length of the swage is approximately 3ʺ, this length allows for some tolerance in building floor-to-floor distances. Each riser joint must be aligned vertically, with a minimum of 1ʺ penetration, though 2ʺ is preferred.

This condition will be met if the floor-to-floor dimensions are as specified and each branch run-out is properly centered. Wide variations in the floor-to-floor dimension may necessitate field modifications to factory risers.

An alternate to swaged connections are compression coupling systems like ProPress®. If these fittings are to be used, the risers are supplied plain ended from the factory with no swaging.

Daikin risers extend 6ʺ above the 86ʺ unit cabinet. From the top of the slab to the top of the riser is 92ʺ.

This height is to be maintained for all units on all floors to ensure that the run-out from the riser to the unit is centered in the opening, as noted above. The remaining riser length extends below the unit cabinet and through the floor slab (typical floor slab is 8ʺ).

The required riser length is determined by knowing the floor-tofloor height (top of slab to top of slab) and adding the additional length of pipe for insertion into the swaged end (typically 2ʺ).

The equation L = F + 2ʺ is used to determine the length of the riser. Where F is your floor-to floor height and the 2ʺ is added for insertion into the swaged end of the riser below.

EXAMPLE: If F = 110ʺ

L = 110ʺ + 2ʺ = 112ʺ

Daikin risers can be supplied up to 120ʺ in length. Though a 120ʺ riser will extend 28ʺ below the unit cabinet and can be difficult to maneuver through a floor slab on site. When the floorto-floor height exceeds 118ʺ or if 28ʺ below the unit is deemed too long, spool pieces can be provided to fill in the gap.

When spool pieces are used, the riser length provided on the units is typically 108ʺ but can be any dimension up to 120ʺ. The spool piece length is determined by the equation Spool = F – L + 4ʺ where the F still equals your floor-to-floor height, L equals the riser length provided on the unit, and the 4ʺ allows for the insertion above and below on the spool piece.

EXAMPLE: If F = 144ʺ and L = 108ʺ

Spool = 144ʺ – 108ʺ + 4ʺ = 40ʺ

### **Riser Expansion**

### **NOTICE**

Daikin does not advise on the location or method of anchoring as this is the responsibility of the engineering company retained to design the riser system.

Risers are not rigidly secured to each fan coil unit. Once installed, they are left free to move up and down with normal vertical expansion and contraction movements in the copper. The internal piping package is designed to allow for ±1¼ʺ of movement, this is why it is critical for the riser run-out to be centered in the 5ʺ opening of the unit at installation. This 1¼ʺ of movement is adequate in smaller low rise buildings; however buildings that exceed 12 stories should be fitted with additional expansion compensators.

The general guideline for the application of riser expansion compensators or loops is as follows:

- 12 to 16 Floors: 1 Expansion Compensator per Riser
- 17 to 28 Floors: 2 Expansion Compensators per Riser

• 29 to 40\* Floors: 3 Expansion Compensators per Riser Compensators should be equally spaced along the height of the riser stack.

The expansion loops are primarily applied to hot water risers (2-pipe changeover and 4 pipe dedicated hot water) as they expand almost 3x that of chilled water risers. If chilled water expansion compensation is required they are typically installed at a quantity of 1 less than the hot water risers.

The expansion loop is provided on the supply riser on one floor, and then on the return riser on an adjacent floor. This is done because the loop is installed inside the supply air plenum of the fan coil cabinet and to install two loops in one unit would restrict the supply air delivery.

*EXAMPLE (Figure 15) A twenty story building with a twopipe changeover riser system. Hot water will run through these risers at least half of the year, chilled water for the other half. Two compensators are provided, spaced as evenly as possible across the total height of the stack.*

Risers themselves should be anchored to the floor slab at multiple points in the building by the installing contractor. Anchor points typically are spaced equally among end points of the stack and any expansion compensators. This should be done so that the risers do not move under gravity and to spread the expansion in opposite directions from the anchor points.

Once anchored to the slab and soldered together, the risers are in effect attached to the building structure, not to the fan coil units. At this point any of the plastic straps used to secure the risers during shipping may be removed or allowed to naturally break off. **The expansion loop support brackets must be removed at this time.**

**NOTE:** Often buildings exceeding 36 floors will break the riser stack in the middle and begin a new stack. This is done to reduce the expansion as well as pipe sizes that can exceed 3ʺ to carry the water for over 40 floors worth of units.

## **Fan Coil Units without Risers**

### **WARNING**

The insulation of the run-outs from the riser to the shut-off valve is the responsibility of the installing contractor.

When a fan coil unit is provided without risers it is called a slave or secondary unit. Slave units may be provided for a number of reasons, including:

- There are existing risers that this new unit will be connected to.
- The unit is part of a master/slave pair where a single riser is used to feed a pair of fan coil units. The master unit ships with the riser attached and the slave unit is connected to a run-out on the master unit by the contractor in the field (typical of hotel applications with mirrored room layouts).

The pipe connections are the same for a slave unit as a unit with the risers attached. Only the riser is missing. A few simple steps are required to install a slave unit to the field riser.

- 1. Remove the shut-off valve supplied in the unit by releasing the union on the coil side.
- 2. Solder the run-out\* end of the shut-off valve to the existing riser run-out.
	- \* Some field piping may be required to bridge the distance between the riser and the slave unit.
- 3. Slide the slave unit into position so that the shut-off valve passes through the 2ʺ × 5ʺ opening in the unit.

The shut-off valve should be inside the fan coil unit so that once the unit is furred-in the shut-off valve will be accessible and the handle fully operable through the return air access panel.

- 4. Re-attach the union side of the shut-off valve to the coil piping package inside the fan coil unit.
- 5. Connect the condensate run-out to the condensate riser.

As with risers attached to the fan coil unit, it is important to center the run-out from the riser to the unit in the opening on the cabinet to allow for the natural expansion and contraction in the riser system.

### *Piping Packages*

The piping package shall include: Ball type shut-off valves on the coil supply and returns (combined with balancing valves or strainers when used), and a two- or three-way control valve with two-position actuator. Chilled water and hot water valves are normally closed.

Control valves are also available in 3 wire floating point or 2-10V DC modulating valves. Additionally balancing waves (manual or automatic) and strainers supplied as riser system dictates. These devices are provided as combo-valves with the shut-off on supply and return and be equipped with PT ports.

### *Electrical Heat*

Units with electric heat shall be wired for single-stage operation with an open wire nickel-chrome element. An auto-reset high limit device shall be included.

### *Filters*

A one-inch MERV. 10 disposable filter shall be shipped loose with return air access panel.

Units equipped with one inch MERV 10 filters have a rating based on ASHRAE Standard 52.2. The average dust spot efficiency is no less than 35 to 40 percent when tested in accordance with ASHRAE 52.1 atmospheric dust spot method.

### *Controls*

### *Thermostat*

The fan coil manufacturer shall supply a low voltage (24V) digital programmable thermostat with remote sensor option and energy savings contacts for remote mounting, or optionally unit mounted. Remote mounted thermostats are connected to a terminal strip that is mounted inside the unit. The thermostat is shipped loose for installation after the unit is installed, dry-wall is applied and the walls are painted.

### *Riser Package*

Risers are available in both type "L" and type "M" copper for supply, return and condensate pipes. Riser insulation is available in ½-inch and one-inch wall thickness for closed cell foam (polyolefin), closed cell elastomeric (similar to Armaflex®) and fiberglass (wrapped with vapor barrier).

Riser diameter and insulation thickness are subject to physical limitations. Contact Daikin when risers are larger than 3.0 inches in diameter. The risers shall have an approximately 3.0 inch swaged expansion at the top end to allow a 3.0 inch insertion of the riser from above without the use of couplings. Risers may be provided plain ended in lieu of swaged for field supplied/installed fittings (similar to Pro-Press®).

The riser insulation shall have a flame spread rating of 25 or less and a smoke developed rating of 50 or less in compliance with ASTME 84. The insulation shall be continuous over the riser length within the height of the cabinet. Provision for insulation beyond the ends of the cabinet shall be the responsibility of the installing contractor.
