# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Features and Benefits**

# **World-Class Design Leader**

As part of Daikin Industries, a Fortune Global 500 company, Daikin Applied is the world's largest air conditioning, heating, ventilating and refrigeration company. We have earned a worldwide reputation for providing a full line of quality products and expertise to meet the demands of our customers. The engineered flexibility of our products allows you to fine tune your HVAC system to meet the specific requirements of your application. You benefit from lower installed and operating costs, high energy efficiency, quiet operation, superior indoor air quality (IAQ) and low cost maintenance and service.

# **Design Features**

# **Excellent Performance**

Daikin Applied offers a wide range of centrifugal vessel and component combinations to provide the right solution for your specific application. The single compressor WSC offers excellent full load performance. Our dual compressor WDC chillers offer many benefits, including outstanding part-load efficiency, and system redundancy similar to two separate chillers, with a lower total installed cost. WCC models also offer the dual compressor advantage, but with counterflow vessels and a separate refrigerant circuit for each compressor. In addition, the WCC excels in full load efficiency. Contact your Daikin Applied representative for detailed information to decide which model is right for your job requirements.

# **Gear Driven Advantage**

Daikin Applied's precision-engineered gear driven design allows for lighter components, less vibration, and ability to select gear ratios that will provide the optimum impeller speed for your application. Older direct-drive designs must use large, heavy impellers to reach similar tip speeds, which cause more vibration and greater stress on shaft and motor during unexpected electrical interruptions.

The compact design and lighter weight components allow for efficient hydrodynamic bearings to be used (079-126 compressor models). This means that during operation, the shaft is supported on a film of lubricant, with no shaft-tobearing contact, providing theoretical infinte life bearings under normal circumstances. The design simplicity of the Daikin Applied centrifugal compressors provides increased durability and reliable performance. For the 160 compressor, an anti-friction bearing is used due to the increased weight of stator motor.

# **Smart Refrigerant**

R-134a is the leading medium pressure refrigerant used in centrifugal and screw compressor chillers until phase-down regulations require alternatives. With a Group A1ASHRAE Safety Classification (the lowest toxicity and flammability rating) and no phsae-out date, R-134a offers great availability, efficiency, capacity, safety, and value. If R-134a is not acceptable in specifications, R-513A is available as a good alternative. R-513A is a near drop-in solution for R-134a when compliance to maximum Global Warming Potential (GWP) limit regulations are necessary in a specification. It has a Group A1 classification with a lower GWP value than R-134a and similar or slightly worse efficiency and capacity characteristics.

# **Exceptional Unloading**

Daikin Applied pioneered the use of moveable discharge geometry to lower the surge point of centrifugal compressors. The point at which the compressor enters a stall or surge condition generally limits compressor unloading. Chillers with a fixed discharge will experience stall or surge at low loads due to refrigerant re-entering the impeller. When in a stall condition, the refrigerant gas is unable to enter the volute due to its low velocity and remains stalled in the impeller. In a surge condition the gas rapidly reverses direction in the impeller causing excessive vibration and heat. Daikin Applied compressors reduce the discharge area as load decreases to maintain gas velocity and greatly reduce the tendency to stall or surge.

#### *Figure 2: Fixed vs. Moveable Discharge Geometry*

<span id="page-3-1"></span>In [Figure 2](#page-3-1), the drawing on the left shows a cross-section view of the operation at full load of a unit with a fixed compressor discharge. At full load, a large quantity of gas is discharged with a fairly uniform discharge velocity as indicated by the arrows.

The center drawing shows a fixed compressor discharge at reduced capacity. Note that the velocity is not uniform and the

refrigerant tends to reenter the impeller. This is caused by low velocity in the discharge area and the high pressure in the condenser, resulting in unstable surge operation and with noise and vibration generated.

[Figure 3](#page-4-0) shows the unique Daikin Applied movable discharge geometry. As the capacity reduces, the movable unloader piston travels inward, reducing the discharge cross section area and maintaining the refrigerant velocity. This mechanism allows our excellent unloading capacity reduction.

#### *Figure 3: Moveable diffuser closes impeller discharge area as load decreases*

<span id="page-4-0"></span># **Trouble-Free Startup**

All Daikin Applied chillers are factory tested on AHRI qualified computer-controlled test stands. Operating controls are checked and adjusted, and the refrigerant charge is adjusted for optimum operation and recorded on the unit nameplate. The testing helps ensure correct operation prior to shipment, and allows factory calibration of chiller operating controls.

All domestic Daikin Applied centrifugal chillers are commissioned by your service representative for Daikin Applied, or by authorized and experienced Daikin Applied startup technicians. This procedure helps ensure that proper starting and checkout procedures are employed and helps in a speedy commissioning process, giving you confidence that your chiller is operating as expected.

# **Lubrication System**

A separately driven electric oil pump assembly supplies lubrication at controlled temperature and pressure to all bearing surfaces and is the source of hydraulic pressure for the capacity control system.

The control system will not allow the compressor to start until oil pressure, at the proper temperature, is established. It also allows the oil pump to operate after compressor shutdown to provide lubrication during coast-down. Lubricant from the pump is supplied to the compressor through a water-cooled, brazedplate heat exchanger and single or dual five-micron oil filters internal to the compressor. All bearing surfaces are pressure lubricated. Drive gears operate in a controlled lubricant mist atmosphere that efficiently cools and lubricates them.

Lubricant is made available under pressure from the compressor oil filter to the unit capacity control system and is used to position the inlet guide vanes in response to changes in leaving chiller water temperature.

If a power failure occurs, an emergency oil reservoir provides adequate lubrication flow under pressure, and prevents damage that could occur during the coast-down period with the oil pump stopped.

Since Daikin Applied chillers are positive pressure, there is no need to change the lubricant or filter on a regular basis. As with any equipment of this type, an annual oil check is recommended to evaluate the lubricant condition.

#### *Figure 4: Lubrication System Schematic*

# **Enhanced Surge Protection**

When centrifugal compressors operate at part load, the volume of refrigerant gas entering the impeller is reduced. At the reduced flow, the impeller's capacity to develop the peak load head is also reduced. At conditions of low refrigerant flow and high compressor head (pressure difference), stall and/or surge can occur (a stall is gas static in the impeller, a surge condition is gas rapidly reversing direction through the impeller). A number of things can contribute to this condition including inadequate maintenance of condenser tube cleanliness, a cooling tower or control malfunction, or unusual ambient temperatures among others.

For these abnormal conditions, Daikin compressor designers have developed a protective control system that senses the potential for a surge, looks at the entire chiller system operation and takes corrective action if possible; or stops the compressor, to help prevent any damage from occurring. This protection is provided as standard on all Daikin centrifugal compressors.

### **The Replacement Market Advantage**

- Retrofit flexibility allows an easy retrofit with flexible knock-down options. See [page 10](#page-9-1) for details.
- Bolt-together construction on single and dual compressor chillers along with factory disassembly available as an option simplify tough entrance situations.
- Opens many options for multiple chiller plants using WDC and WCC combinations.

### **Heat Recovery Models**

For decades, Daikin Applied has pioneered the use of heat recovery chillers and the unique Daikin Applied Templifier® Heat Pump Water Heater to reduce energy costs. These products have become more important than ever with the current emphasis on total building efficiency. ASHRAE Efficiency Standard 90.1 mandates the use of heat recovery equipment of this type in a wide range of buildings.

### *Heat Recovery Chillers*

Model HSC heat recovery chillers, with a single compressor, have a single condenser with split bundles, i.e., two separate water passages divided by separate water heads. The inboard water connections are connected to the cooling tower, the other water side is connected to the heating system. The economic feasibility of hot water generated with these units depends on heating and cooling load profiles and on the relative cost of the available energy sources. A compressor's kW per ton is heavily influenced by the pressure head it is pumping against. During heat recovery operation, the entire cooling load is operating against the high head required by the hot water temperature. For this reason, it is desirable to maximize the percentage of the total rejected heat used for the heating load. Daikin Applied's economic evaluation program, Energy Analyzer® 3, available from your local Daikin sales office, is the perfect tool to determine the economic feasibility of using this proven technology.

# **Variable Frequency Drives (VFD)**

The Variable Frequency Drive option is a technology that is used to control motor speed on a wide variety of motor-drive applications. When applied to centrifugal compressor motors, significant gains in compressor part load performance can be realized. The improvement in efficiency and reduction of annual energy cost is maximized when there are long periods of part load operation, combined with low compressor lift (lower condenser water temperatures). When atmospheric conditions permit, Daikin Applied chillers equipped with VFDs can operate with entering condenser as low as 55°F (13°C), which results in extremely low kW/ton values.

Starting Inrush: The use of a VFD on centrifugal chillers also provides an excellent method of reducing motor starting inrush, which is even better than solid-state starters. Starting current can be closely controlled since both the frequency and voltage are regulated. This can be an important benefit to a building's electrical distribution system.

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Electrical Data**

# **Wiring and Conduit**

Wire sizes must comply with local and state electrical codes. Where total amperes require larger conductors than a single conduit would permit, limited by dimensions of motor terminal box, two or more conduits can be used. Where multiple conduits are used, all three phases must be balanced in each conduit. Failure to balance each conduit will result in excessive heating of the conductors and unbalanced voltage.

An interposing relay can be required on remote mounted starter applications when the length of the conductors run between the chiller and starter is excessive.

Use only copper supply wires with ampacity based on 75°C conductor rating. (Exception: for equipment rated over 2000 volts, 90°C or 105°C rated conductors shall be used).

# **Power Factor Correction Capacitors**

Do not use power factor correction capacitors with centrifugal chillers with a compressor VFD. Doing so can cause harmful electrical resonance in the system. Correction capacitors are not necessary since VFDs inherently maintain high power factors.

# **Control Power**

The 115-volt control power can be supplied from the starter or a transformer (meeting the requirements of Daikin Applied Starter Specification 359999 Rev 29) separate from the starter. Either source must be properly fused with 25-amp dual element fuses or with a circuit breaker selected for motor duty. If the control transformer or other power source for the control panel is remote from the unit, conductors must be sized for a maximum voltage drop of 3%. Required circuit ampacity is 25 amps at 115 volts. Conductor size for long runs between the control panel and power source, based upon National Electrical Code limitations for 3% voltage drop, can be determined from the table below.

#### *Table 2: Control Power Line Sizing*


**NOTE:** Maximum length is the distance a conductor will traverse between the control power source and the unit control panel.

**NOTE:** Panel terminal connectors will accommodate up to number 10 AWG wire. Larger conductors will require an intermediate junction box.

# <span id="page-10-1"></span>**Starter Types and Descriptions**

Daikin Applied offers a variety of motor and starter types to fit a wide array of applications. Solid State, Across-The-Line, and Fixed Speed by Others starter types are available for fixed speed options, while Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) are offered for variable speed operation. For additional information on starters and VFDs, consult your local Daikin Applied sales office.

Some voltage and starter type configurations can be unit mounted and wired at the factory, but when the unit mounted starters are too large to ship on the unit, they are shipped loose with cable kits and mounting brackets for field installation on the unit by others. Additionally, freestanding starters are furnished by Daikin Applied and shipped to the job site for setting and wiring by others. Fixed Speed by Others starters are furnished and installed by others, but must meet Daikin Applied Specification 359999 Rev 29, available at your local Daikin Applied sales office.

#### *Table 3: Starter Mounting Options by Voltage*


11------------------------------------------------



# **Variable Frequency Drives (VFD)**

A VFD modulates the compressor speed in response to load and vessel pressures, resulting in excellent part load performance. VFDs are most beneficial when there is reduced load and low compressor lift (condenser water temperatures) dominating the operating hours.

The traditional method of controlling centrifugal compressor capacity is with inlet guide vanes (IGVs). However, capacity is most optimally reduced by using both a VFD and IGVs. The VFD slows the compressor (impeller tip) speed as much as possible to make the required compressor lift, while IGVs take over to make up the difference in required capacity reduction

The chart below illustrates the relative IPLV efficiencies of Daikin Applied models for a typical 1,200 Ton selection at AHRI conditions. VFD's offer a significant improvement in part load performance compared to their fixed speed counterparts.

### *Figure 6: IPLV Comparison by Model*

The IPLV values (defined on page 29) are AHRI Certified Ratings based on AHRI Standard 550/590, Standard for Water Chilling Packages Using the Vapor Compression Cycle. Full load is at 44 F chilled water temperature with 2.4 gpm/ton, 85 F entering condenser water temperatures with 3 gpm/ton. Part load points of 75%, 50%, and 25% employ condenser water temperature relief (reduction) per the standard.

# **VFDs and Distortion**

Despite the many benefits, care must be taken when applying VFDs due to the impact that they may have on the building's electrical system. VFDs can cause distortion of the AC line because they are nonlinear loads; that is, they don't draw sinusoidal current from the line. They instead only draw current during the peaks of the AC line. This flattens the top of the voltage waveform. Most other modern electronic equipment is also a nonlinear load, but VFDs tend to have a greater impact because of their large power demand. Although harmonics are associated with non-linear loads, it is extremely rare that VFD generated harmonics are an issue in systems with a minimum of 5% internal impedance.

Power line harmonic distortion can be a concern for a number of reasons:

- 1. Current harmonics can cause additional heating of transformers, conductors, and switchgear. They can also cause nuisance tripping of circuit breakers and clearing of fuses.
- 2. Voltage harmonics may disrupt the operation of devices which require a smooth, sinusoidal voltage waveform.
- 3. High-frequency components of voltage distortion can interfere with signals which are transmitted on the AC power line.

The harmonics of concern are often the 5th, 7th, 11th, and 13th. Even harmonics, harmonics divisible by three, and harmonics above the 13th harmonic are usually not a problem for three-phase power systems.

The optional Daikin Applied Drive Passive Filter Package provides a broader range of harmonic reduction performance than VFDs, which use active rectifiers. This is particularly true at reduced loads, where VFDs provide the greatest energy savings.

### *Current Harmonics*

An increase in reactive impedance in front of the VFD helps reduce the harmonic currents. Reactive impedance can be added in the following ways:

- 1. Mount the drive far from the source transformer.
- 2. Add line reactors.
- 3. Use an isolation transformer.

### *Voltage Harmonics*

Voltage distortion is caused by the flow of harmonic currents through a source impedance. A reduction in source impedance to the point of common coupling (PCC) will result in a reduction in voltage harmonics. This may be done in the following ways:

- 1. Keep the PCC as far from the drives (close to the power source) as possible.
- 2. Increase the size (decrease the impedance) of the source transformer.
- 3. Increase the capacity (decrease the impedance) of the busway or cables from the source to the PCC.
- 4. Make sure that added reactance is downstream (closer to the VFD than the source) from the PCC.

12------------------------------------------------



### *The IEEE 519 Standard*

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has developed a standard that recommends distortion limits for both power utilities and their customers. The purpose of these limits is to ensure that the voltage distortion of the utility's public power grid is maintained at an acceptable level. To accomplish this, IEEE 519-2014 presents recommended harmonic current distortion limits for utility customers. These limits are based on the peak demand of the customer. This is called the Total Demand Distortion (TDD). This standard provides a sliding scale for the recommended TDD limit for each utility customer. The greater the demand that a customer places on the utility, the more stringent the recommended TDD limits.

IEEE 519-2014 clearly states that the TDD is to be measured at the point where a utility customer connects to the public utility. It does not apply to any points inside the customer's facility; it only applies to the point where another utility customer could connect to the public power grid. If the utility's customers comply with the TDD limits stated in IEEE 519-2014, it is then the utility's responsibility to provide voltage to its customers that meets the harmonic voltage recommendations of this standard.

Actual optimum unit selection will vary with building application and system design. Applications with minimal hours of operation cannot justify a very low kW per ton (COP) unit. Applications with high hours of operation will justify high part load as well as full load efficiency units. For optimum selection an energy analysis is available through your local Daikin Applied sales representative.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

# **Location**

These chillers are intended only for installation in an indoor or weather protected area consistent with the NEMA 1 rating on the chiller, controls, and electrical panels. If indoor sub-freezing temperatures are possible, special precautions must be taken to avoid equipment damage.

### **CAUTION**

Daikin Applied Centrifugal Chillers are intended only for installation in indoor areas protected from temperature extremes. Failure to comply may result in equipment damage and may void the manufacturer warranty.

# **Equipment Room Guidelines**

### *Table 4: Equipment Room Guidelines*


# **Operating/Standby Limits**

### *Table 5: Operating/Standby Limits*



# **Water Piping**

All evaporators and condensers have OGS-type grooved water connections (adhering to Standard AWWA C606) or optional flange connections. The installing contractor must provide matching mechanical connections. PVC piping should not be used. Be sure that water inlet and outlet connections match certified drawings and nozzle markings.

### **CAUTION**

If welding is to be performed on the mechanical or flange connections:

- 1. Remove the solid-state temperature sensor, thermostat bulbs, and nozzle mounted flow switches from the wells to prevent damage to those components.
- 2. Properly ground the unit or severe damage to the MicroTech® unit controller can occur.
- **NOTE:** ASME certification will be revoked if welding is performed on a vessel shell or tube sheet.

The water heads can be interchanged (end for end) so that the water connections can be made at either end of the unit. If this is done, use new head gaskets and relocate the control sensors.

Field installed water piping to the chiller must include:

- air vents at the high points.
- a cleanable water strainer upstream of the evaporator and condenser inlet connections.
- a flow proving device for both the evaporator and condenser to prevent freeze up. Flow switches, thermal dispersion switches, or Delta-P switches can be used. Note that flow switches are factory installed. Additional flow switches can be used only if they are connected in series with the ones already provided. Connect additional flow switches in series between original flow switch inputs.
- sufficient shutoff valves to allow vessel isolation. The chiller must be capable of draining the water from the evaporator or condenser without draining the complete system.

It is recommended that field installed water piping to the chiller include:

- thermometers at the inlet and outlet connections of both vessels.
- water pressure gauge connection taps and gauges at the inlet and outlet connections of both vessels for measuring water pressure drop.

15------------------------------------------------



The piping must be supported to eliminate weight and strain on the fittings and connections. Piping must also be adequately insulated. Sufficient shutoff valves must be installed to permit draining the water from the evaporator or condenser without draining the complete system.

### *Optimum Water Temperatures and Flow Rates*

A key to improving energy efficiency for any chiller is minimizing the compressor pressure lift. Reducing the lift reduces the compressor work and its energy consumption per unit of output.

The optimum plant design must take into account all of the interactions between chiller, pumps, and tower. The Daikin Applied Energy Analyzer® 3 program is an excellent tool to investigate the entire system efficiency, quickly and accurately. It is especially good at comparing different system types and operating parameters. Contact your local Daikin Applied sales office for assistance on your particular application.

# **Evaporator**

### *Evaporator temperature drop*

The industry standard has been a ten-degree temperature drop in the evaporator. Increasing the drop to 12 or 14 degrees will improve the evaporator heat transfer, raise the suction pressure, and improve chiller efficiency. Chilled water pump energy will also be reduced.

### *Higher leaving chilled water temperatures*

Warmer leaving chilled water temperatures will raise the compressor's suction pressure and decrease the lift, improving efficiency. Using 45° F (7.0° C) leaving water instead of 42° F (5.5° C) will make a significant improvement.

# **Condenser**

### *Condenser entering water temperature*

As a general rule, a one-degree drop in condenser entering water temperature will reduce chiller energy consumption by two percent. Cooler water lowers the condensing pressure and reduces compressor work. One or two degrees can make a noticeable difference. The incremental cost of a larger tower can be small and provide a good return on investment.

### *Minimum Condenser Water Temperature Operation*

When ambient wet bulb temperatures are lower than design, the condenser water temperature can be allowed to fall. Lower temperatures will improve chiller performance.

Depending on local climatic conditions, using the lowest possible entering condenser water temperature may be more costly in total system power consumed than the expected savings in chiller power would suggest, due to the excessive fan power required.

Cooling tower fans must continue to operate at 100% capacity at low wet bulb temperatures. As chillers are selected for lower kW per ton, the cooling tower fan motor power becomes a higher percentage of the total peak load chiller power. Daikin Applied's Energy Analyzer® 3 program can optimize the chiller/tower operation for specific buildings in specific locales.

Even with tower fan control, some form of water flow control, such as tower bypass, is recommended.

### *Condenser water temperature rise*

The industry standard of 3 gpm/ton or about a 9.5-degree delta-T works well for most applications. Reducing condenser water flow to lower pumping energy will increase the water temperature rise, resulting in an increase in the compressor's condensing pressure and energy consumption. This is usually not a productive strategy.

### **System analysis**

Although Daikin Applied is a proponent of analyzing the entire system, it is generally effective to place the chiller in the most efficient mode because it is, by far, a larger energy consumer than pumps. The Daikin Applied Energy Analyzer® 3 program is an excellent tool to investigate the entire system efficiency, quickly and accurately. It is especially good at comparing different system types and operating parameters. Utility costs, load factors, maintenance costs, cost of capital, tax bracket; essentially all factors affecting owning cost, must be considered as well. Generally, the attempts to save the last few full load kW are very costly. For example, the cost to go from 0.58 to 0.57 kW/ ton could be significant because of the large number of copper tubes that would have to be added to the heat exchangers. Contact your local Daikin Applied sales representative for assistance on your particular application.

### **Mixing Single and Dual Compressor Chillers**

WDC dual compressor chillers excel at part load operation, while single compressor chillers usually have better full load efficiency. A good chiller plant strategy is to install one dual and one or more single compressor units. Run the dual until it is fully loaded, then switch to the single compressor unit and run it only at full load, using the dual to trim the load.

### **Series Counterflow and Series Parallel Chillers**

The design of piping systems can greatly impact chiller performance. A popular system is to place the evaporators in series with the chilled water flowing from one evaporator to the next as shown. Two different condenser water piping arrangements can be used. Parallel flow ([Figure 8](#page-16-0)) divides the total condenser flow between the two condensers. The counterflow system ([Figure 9](#page-16-1)) puts all of the condenser water through the condenser of the lag chiller (chiller producing the coldest evaporator leaving water) and then through the lead chiller (chiller seeing the warmest evaporator water temperatures).

16------------------------------------------------



Typically, since the lead machine will see the warmest evaporator water, it will have the greater capacity and larger portion of the total system evaporator temperature drop. The lead machine has an 8.4 degree drop (56.0°F-47.6°F) and the lag machine has a 5.6 degree drop (47.6°F - 42.0°F).

Condenser water flow is important to overall system efficiency. With parallel flow, the condensers have identical flow conditions (95 to 85 degrees in this example) with the compressor lift shown. With counterflow arrangement the lift on the lead machine is significantly lower, reducing compressor work and making the overall system efficiency about 2% better. Even though the chiller performance is different, it is good practice to use the same chiller models.

Both the WSC and WDC chillers are suitable for series counterflow arrangement and include controls specifically designed for series chillers. For more information, please refer to Application guide AG -31-003: Chiller Plant Design. Daikin Applied's model WCC dual compressor chiller (1000 to 2700 tons) combines counterflow design into one unit.

# **Oil Coolers**

Daikin Applied WSC079 to WSC126 model centrifugal chillers have a factory-mounted oil cooler with a temperature controlled water regulating valve and solenoid valve for each compressor. Cooling water connections are located at the rear of the unit, near the compressor and are shown on the specific unit certified drawings. For the WSC160 model, the compressor has an integrated refrigerant cooled oil cooler.

Field water piping to the inlet and outlet connections must be installed according to good piping practices and must include stop valves to isolate the cooler for servicing. A 1" minimum cleanable filter (40 mesh maximum) and drain valve or plug must also be field installed. The water supply for the oil cooler must be from the chilled water circuit, or from an independent clean source such as city water. When using chilled water, it is important that the water pressure drop across the evaporator is greater than the pressure drop across the oil cooler or insufficient oil cooler flow will result. If the pressure drop across the evaporator is less than the oil cooler, the oil cooler must be piped across the chilled water pump, provided that its pressure drop is sufficient. The water flow through the oil cooler will be adjusted by the unit's regulating valve so that the temperature of oil supplied to the compressor bearings (leaving the oil cooler) is between 90°F and 110°F (32°C and 43°C).

| OIL COOLER |     |



**NOTE:** The system must be designed for the highest cooling water temperature possible, which may occur for a short time during startup.

Compressors using chilled water for oil cooling will often start with warm "chilled water" in the system until the chilled water loop temperature is pulled down. With cooling water in the 40°F to 55°F (4°C to 13°C) range, considerably less water will be used and the pressure drop will be greatly reduced. The following table contains oil cooler data at various inlet water temperatures.

#### *Table 6: WSC Oil Cooler Data*


#### *Table 7: WSC with VFD Oil Cooler Data*


**NOTE:** Pressure drops include valves on the unit.

When supplied with city water, the oil piping must discharge through a trap into an open drain to prevent draining the cooler by siphoning. The city water can also be used for cooling tower makeup by discharging it into the tower sump from a point above the highest possible water level.

**NOTE:** Particular attention must be paid to chillers with variable chilled water flow through the evaporator. The pressure drop available at low flow rates can very well be insufficient to supply the oil cooler with enough water. In this case an auxiliary booster pump can be used or city water employed. Cooling Water Connection Sizes WSCs 079-126 are 1 in. FPT.

18------------------------------------------------



### **Pumps**

Model WSC chiller compressor motors operate at 3600 rpm on 60 Hz power (3000 rpm on 50 Hz). When VFDs are employed, the hertz/speed can be reduced by 70%. To avoid the possibility of objectionable harmonics in the system piping, 4-pole, 1800/1500 rpm system pumps should be used. The condenser water pump(s) must be cycled off when the last chiller of the system cycles off. This will keep cold condenser water from migrating refrigerant to the condenser. Cold liquid refrigerant in the condenser can make start-up difficult. In addition, turning off the condenser water pump(s) when the chillers are not operating will conserve energy.

Include thermometers and pressure gauges at the chiller inlet and outlet connections and air vents at the high points of piping. The water heads can be interchanged (end for end), allowing water connections to be made at either end of the unit. Use new head gaskets when interchanging water heads. When water pump noise is objectionable, use rubber isolation sections at both the inlet and outlet of the pump. Vibration eliminator sections in the condenser inlet and outlet water lines are not normally required. Where noise and vibration are critical and the unit is mounted on spring isolators, flexible piping and conduit connections are necessary. If not factory installed, a flow switch or pressure differential switch must be installed in the leaving chilled water line in accordance with the flow switch manufacturer's instructions.

Be sure that water inlet and outlet connections match certified drawings and nozzle markings. All evaporators and condensers have OGS-type grooved water connections (adhering to Standard AWWA C606) or optional flange connections. The installing contractor must provide matching mechanical connections. PVC piping should not be used.

# **Filtering and Treatment**

Owners and operators must be aware that if the unit is operating with a cooling tower, cleaning and flushing the cooling tower is required. Ensure tower blow-down or bleedoff is operating. Atmospheric air contains many contaminants, which increases the need for water treatment. The use of untreated water will result in corrosion, erosion, slime buildup, scaling, or algae formation. A water treatment service should be used. Daikin Applied is not responsible for damage or faulty operation from untreated or improperly treated water.

# **Machine Room Ventilation**

In the market today, centrifugal chillers are available with either hermetic or open type motors. Hermetic motors are cooled with refrigerant and dissipate their heat through the cooling tower. On the other hand, open motors circulate equipment room air across themselves for cooling and reject the heat to the equipment room. Daikin Applied chillers have hermetic motors and DO NOT require additional ventilation.

For chillers with open-drive type, air-cooled motors, good engineering practice dictates that the motor heat be removed to prevent high equipment room temperatures. In many applications this requires a large volume of ventilation air, or mechanical cooling to properly remove this motor heat.

EXAMPLE: 1000 tons x 0.6 kW/Ton x 0.04 motor heat loss x 0.284 Tons/kW = 7 tons (24 kW) cooling

The energy and installation costs of ventilation or mechanical cooling equipment must be considered when evaluating various chillers. For a fair comparison, the kW used for the ventilation fans, or if mechanical cooling is required, the additional cooling and fan energy must be added to the open motor compressor energy when comparing hermetic drives. Additionally, significant costs occur for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of the ventilation or air handling units.

Equipment room ventilation and safety requirements for various refrigerants is a complex subject and is updated from time to time. The latest edition of ASHRAE 15 should be consulted.

# **Thermal Storage**

Daikin Applied chillers are designed for use in thermal storage systems. The chillers have two operating conditions that must be considered. The first is normal air-conditioning duty where leaving evaporator fluid temperatures range from 40°F to 45°F (4.4°C to 7.2°C). The second condition occurs during the ice making process when leaving fluid temperatures are in the 22°F to 26°F (-5.6°C to -3.3°C) range.

The MicroTech® II control system will accommodate both operating points. The ice mode can be started or stopped by an input signal to the microprocessor from a BAS or through a chilled water reset signal. When a signal is received to change from the ice mode to the normal operating mode, the chiller will shut down until the system fluid temperature rises to the higher setpoint. The chiller will then restart and continue operation at the higher leaving fluid temperature. When changing from normal cooling to the ice mode, the chiller will load to maximum capacity until the lower setpoint is reached.

Computer selections must be made to check that the chiller will operate at both conditions. If the "ice mode" is at night, the pressure differentials between the evaporator and condenser are usually similar to normal cooling applications. The leaving fluid temperature is lower, but the condensing temperature is also lower because the cooling tower water is colder. If the ice mode can also operate during the day, when cooling tower water temperatures are high, a proper selection becomes more difficult because the two refrigerant pressure differentials are significantly different.

A three-way condenser water control valve is always required.

19------------------------------------------------



### **Variable Speed Pumping**

Variable speed pumping involves changing system water flow relative to cooling load changes. Daikin Applied centrifugal chillers are designed for this duty with two limitations.

First, the rate of change in the water flow needs to be slow, not greater than 10% of the change per minute. The chiller needs time to sense a load change and respond.

Second, the water velocity in the vessels must be 3 to 10 fps (0.91 and 3.0 m/sec). Below 3 fps (0.91 m/sec), laminar flow occurs which reduces heat transfer. Above 10 fps (3.0 m/sec), excessively high pressure drops and tube erosion occur. These flow limits can be determined from the Daikin Applied selection program.

We recommend variable flow only in the evaporator because there is virtually no change in chiller efficiency compared to constant flow. In other words, there is no chiller energy penalty. Although variable speed pumping can be done in the condenser loop, it is usually unwise. The intent of variable flow is to reduce pump horsepower. However, reducing condenser water flow increases the chiller's condensing pressure, increasing the lift that the compressor must overcome which, in turn, increases the compressor's energy use. Consequently, pump energy savings can be lost because the chiller operating power is significantly increased.

Low condenser flow can cause premature tube fouling and subsequent increased compressor power consumption. Increased cleaning and/or chemical use can also result.

### **System Water Volume**

All chilled water systems need adequate time to recognize a load change, respond to that load change and stabilize, without undesirable short cycling of the compressors or loss of control. In air conditioning systems, the potential for short cycling usually exists when the building load falls below the minimum chiller plant capacity or on close-coupled systems with very small water volumes.

Some of the things the designer should consider when looking at water volume are the minimum cooling load, the minimum chiller plant capacity during the low load period and the desired cycle time for the compressors.

Assuming that there are no sudden load changes and that the chiller plant has reasonable turndown, a rule of thumb of "gallons of water volume equal to two to three times the chilled water gpm flow rate" is often used.

A properly designed storage tank should be added if the system components do not provide sufficient water volume.

### **Vibration Mounting**

Every Daikin Applied chiller is run tested and compressor vibration is measured and limited to a maximum rate of 0.14 inches per second, which is considerably more stringent than other available compressors. Consequently, floor-mounted spring isolators are not usually required. Rubber mounting pads are shipped with each unit. It is wise to continue to use piping flexible connectors to reduce sound transmitted into the pipe and to allow for expansion and contraction.

# **AHRI Standard 575 Sound Ratings**

Sound data in accordance with AHRI Standard 575 for individual units are available from your local Daikin Applied representative. Due to the large number of component combinations and variety of applications, sound data is not included in this catalog.

# **Glycol Operation**

The addition of glycol to the chilled water system for freeze protection can be required for special applications.

### **Certifications and Standards**

As with many other Daikin Applied chiller products, the centrifugal chiller models meet all necessary certifications and standards.

# **AHRI Certification**

AHRI Standard 550/590 for Water-Chilling and Heat Pump Water-Heating Packages Using the Vapor Compression Cycle defines certification and testing procedures and performance tolerances of all units that fall within the scope of the standard.

Full AHRI 550/590 participation and certification is an on-going commitment at Daikin Applied. Daikin Applied centrifugal chillers are rated and certified in accordance with the latest edition of AHRI Standard 550/590. The AHRI label affixed to units certifies that the unit will meet the specified performance.

Daikin Applied SelectTools (DST) for Centrifugal Chillers is used to select and rate chillers for specific job conditions. The program version number and issue date are listed in the AHRI Directory of Certified Applied Air-Conditioning Products available at www.ahridirectory. org. DST ratings are available from your local Daikin Applied sales representative..

Part load performance can be presented in terms of Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) or Non-Standard Part Load Values (NPLV), both of which are defined by AHRI Standard 550/590. Based on this standard, and as shown in the figure below, a typical chiller can operate up to 99% of the time at off-peak conditions and usually spends most of this time at less than 60% of design capacity.

20------------------------------------------------



*Figure 12: IPLV Defined by AHRI Standard 550/590* 

# **Compliance with ASHRAE Std.90.1**

ASHRAE Standard 90.1 was developed to assist owners and designers in making informed choices on a building's design, systems, and equipment selection. Daikin Applied centrifugal chillers can significantly exceed ASHRAE 90.1 minimum efficiency requirements.

# **LEED®**

For building owners who wish to pursue Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Certification, the performance of the Daikin Applied chillers may contribute points towards Energy and Atmosphere (EA) Credits.

Points earned for Optimize Energy Performance (formerly EA Credit 1) are awarded based on overall building efficiency. The high efficiency of the Daikin Applied chillers will contribute to the total points earned for this credit. Enhanced Refrigerant Management (formerly EA Credit 4) qualification is partially determined by tonnage and refrigerant quantity. Vessel stack and tube count selections will affect the quantity of refrigerant in the chiller.

Consult with your Daikin Applied sales representative for more information.

# **Relief Valves**

Relief valve connection sizes are 1-inch FPT, with a relief valve (3/8 inch flare) on the top of the oil sump of all units.

All relief valves (including the oil sump) must be piped to the outside of the building in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE 15- 2001. The new 2001 standard has revised the calculation method compared to previous issues.

Twin relief valves, mounted on a transfer valve, are used on the condenser so that one relief valve can be shut off and removed for testing or replacement, leaving the other in operation. Only one of the two valves is in operation at any time. Where four valves are shown, on some large vessels, they consist of two relief valves mounted on each of two transfer valves. Only two relief valves of the four are active at any time.

#### *Figure 13: Tpical Vent Piping*

Vent piping is sized for only one valve of the set since only one can be in operation at a time.

### *Relief Pipe Sizing (ASHRAE Method)*

Relief valve pipe sizing is based on the discharge capacity for the given evaporator or condenser and the length of piping to be run.

Daikin Applied centrifugal chillers have the following relief valve settings and discharge capacity:

- WSC evaporator (1 valve) and condenser (2 valves piped together to common vent pipe) = 200 psi, 75.5 lb of air/ min
- Note: some large condensers have 4 relief valves
- **NOTE:** A 1-inch pipe is too small to handle these valves. A pipe increaser must be installed at the valve outlet.

Per ASHRAE Standard 15, the pipe size cannot be less than the relief device. The discharge from more than one relief valve can be run into a common header, the area of which shall not be less than the sum of the areas of the connected pipes. For further details, refer to ASHRAE Standard 15.

The above information is a guide only. Consult local codes and/or latest version of ASHRAE Standard 15 for sizing data.
