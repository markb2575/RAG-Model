6------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-6-1"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>**Hot Gas Reheat Coil**

For improved indoor climate control, Daikin Applied offers accurate and cost effective dehumidification control using a hot gas reheat option known as smart dehumidification. Hot gas reheat with smart dehumidification is an excellent solution for applications where maintaining low humidity in a space is crucial.

# **Waterside Economizer**

The waterside economizer option helps to reduce energy consumption by using cold loop water temperature to condition a space without energizing mechanical cooling. Even in the coldest weather a space can experience a build-up of ambient heat from people, equipment, lighting and the sun.

Buildings benefit from the waterside economizer when loop temperatures are cool enough to provide air conditioning. The waterside economizer includes a hydronic cooling coil located upstream of the unit's evaporator coil. When entering water temperatures are between 40° to 70°F, a call for 1st-stage cooling will divert the cold water to the economizer coil. A call for 2nd-stage cooling will allow simultaneous compressor operation whenever the loop temperature is below the changeover temperature.

# **Cabinet Configurations**

The SmartSource compact cabinet is fabricated from heavy gauge G-60 galvanized sheet metal.

Two cabinet configurations are available in either a left-hand or right-hand return air arrangement to provide the optimum return air location and service access.

**Note:** *Unit left or right hand is determined by facing the piping connection (front) side of unit*

#### *What our customers are saying;*

*"*The service guys love the design of the GCV unit, serviceability overall is excellent.*"*

With smart dehumidification, once the space temperature is satisfied, the humidistat signal diverts the high temperature refrigerant gas to the reheat coil located downstream of the cooling coil. The conditioned and reheated air prevents over cooling of the space and maximizes moisture removal for improved indoor comfort. With the optional ECM fan system, the air flow is adjusted for optimal moisture removal, and helps keep sound levels at a minimum. It is especially effective during low load conditions when proper control is critical.

# **Hydronic Heat**

The hydronic heat option helps to reduce energy consumption by using warm loop water temperatures to condition a space without energizing mechanical heating.

The unit includes a hydronic heating coil located downstream of the unit evaporator coil. When entering water temperatures are between 90° to 120°F, a call for heating will divert the warm water to the hydronic coil.

An optional control sequence allows compressor heating

operation when the loop water is below 90**°** F. In this sequence, the control system will automatically switch from compressor heating to hydronic heating based on the loop temperature. With optional ECM smart fan controls sound levels can be reduced by adjusting air flow during hydronic heat operation.

7------------------------------------------------

Three additional 1/4ʺ taps are plugged and available for accessories when specified. A variety of pipe connections are available on both the fixed and union ends. Standard end connections are female pipe thread.

# **Shutoff Ball Valves with Memory Stop**

Constructed of brass and rated at 400 psig (2758 kPa) maximum working pressure. Valves have a built-in adjustable memory stop to eliminate rebalancing. Valves have FPT connections on both ends for connection to the water hose and to the field piping.

# **Standard Unit Typical Installation**

## *Installation & Location*

SmartSource vertical water source heat pumps can be installed "free standing" in an equipment room; however, closet installations are more common for the small vertical type units. Generally, the unit is located in the corner of a closet with the non-ducted return air facing 90-degrees to the door and the major access panels facing the door as shown in [Figure 5](#page-15-1). Alternatively, the unit can have a ducted return air with the opening facing the door and the major access panels facing 90-degrees to the door.

Locate a vertical unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 24" (610 mm) clearance on the front of the unit for service and maintenance access. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out.

To reduce noise emissions, install a field-provided isolator pad beneath the entire base of the vertical unit. The pad should be equal to the overall foot-print size of the unit to provide sound dampening of the unit while in operation.

#### *Installation & Location*

When installing the Compact unit with a hydronic heat section, the same location criteria described for the standard unit application apply. Although hydronic unit piping requires single inlet, outlet and a "jumper" connection as shown in [Figure 7](#page-16-1)

17------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Ductwork and Attenuation**

## *Vertical Unit*

All ductwork should conform to industry standards of good practice as described in ASHRAE Systems Guide. The discharge duct system will normally consist of a flexible (boot) connector at the unit, a short run of acoustically insulated duct (approximately 10'), an 90-degree elbow without vanes, and a trunk duct teeing into a branch

circuit with discharge diffusers as illustrated in [Figure 11.](#page-17-1) Return air ducts can be brought in through a wall grille and then to the unit. The return duct system will normally consist of a flexible connector at the unit and a trunk duct to the return air grille. With metal duct material, the return air duct should be internally lined with acoustic insulation for sound attenuation.

*Figure 10: Typical installation using ducted return*

#### <span id="page-17-1"></span>*Figure 11: Vertical unit duct example*

18------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-18-0"></span># **Piping**

The water source heat pump unit is typically connected to the supply / return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydronic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

Daikin has available optional hose kit combinations to better facilitate system flow balancing. These flexible hoses reduce vibration between the unit and the rigid piping system.

Polyolester Oil, commonly know as POE oil is a synthetic oil used in many refrigeration systems. POE oil, if ever in contact with PVC/CPVC will coat the inside wall of PVC/ CPVC pipe causing environmental stress fractures.

Although there is no PVC/CPVC piping in this product, please keep this in mind when selecting piping materials for your application, as system failure and property damage could result. For these reasons Daikin Applied does not recommend the use of PVC/CPVC water piping.

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Water System Quality**

The cleaning, flushing and chemical treatment of a water source heat pump system is fundamental to efficient operation and the life expectancy of the system.

Potential system problems produced by the use of water fall into three general categories:

- **1. Scale formation**  Mineral deposits which result from the crystallization and precipitation of dissolved salts in the water. The deposits form an insulating barrier, reducing the heat transfer rate and impeding the circulation of fluids due to increased pressure drop.
- **2. Corrosion** Decomposition of the metal caused by absorption of gases from the air. Corrosion may occur in any metal component of the system.
- **3. Organic growths** Slime and algae which form under certain environmental conditions, and can reduce the heat transfer rate by forming an insulating coating or can promote corrosion by pitting.

The system water should be evaluated for degrees of impurity, with testing available from independent testing labs, health departments or state agencies.

[Table 4](#page-19-1) is a list of water characteristics, the potential impurities and their results and the recommended treatment.

## *Avoiding Potential Problems*

As shown in [Table 4](#page-19-1), all water contains some degree of impurities which may affect the performance of a heat pump system. The use of a cupro-nickel coil can help avoid potential problems. Water flow rates should:

- **A.** Be high enough that the temperature rise through the heat exchanger does not exceed 10° F when operating in the cooling mode.
- **B.** Not exceed 4 GPM per nominal ton. Flow rates that have velocities of 10 feet per second or more may cause pipe erosion and heat exchanger failure.


#### <span id="page-19-1"></span>*Table 4: Water impurities, result & recommended water system application*

*Notes: 1. The tremendous variety in water quality around the country makes the recommendation of a single best method of treatment impossible. Consult a local water treatment specialist for specific treatment recommendations.*

*2. Cupro-Nickel is recommended if iron bacteria is present, suspended solids or dissolved oxygen levels are high.*

*3. If the concentration of these corrosives exceeds the maximum tabulated in the cupro-nickel column, then the potential for serious corrosion problems exists.*

<span id="page-20-0"></span># **Condensate Drain**

Vertical units have a 3/4-inch FPT condensate drain connection, flush to the unit. The field installed condensate piping must include a trap after the connection and be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

Improper trapping can lead to several problems. If the trap is too tall, negative pressure will prevent drainage, causing condensate backup. If the trap is too short the seal will be destroyed or nonexistent, producing the same effect as a non-trapped system.

Construct the trap of 7/8" clear plastic piping. The condensate piping from the drain trap must be sloped to facilitate proper drainage. The clear plastic trap should be clamped and removable for cleaning. It may be necessary to manually fill the trap at system startup, or to run the unit for sufficient time to build a condensate seal. The condensate trap and condensate piping drainage should be free of any foreign debris. Debris can prevent proper drainage and unit operation and result in condensate buildup.

#### *Table 5: Air limits in* **°***F (***°***C)*


#### *Table 6: Fluid limits*


*Notes: 1 Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Extended range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.*

*2 This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

*3 Unit with waterside economizer option can operate in economizer cooling mode down to 40*°*F (4*°*C).*

<span id="page-24-0"></span># **Fan Performance - Optional Constant CFM EC Motor (Sizes 015–070)**

<span id="page-24-1"></span>*Table 10: Single stage units with constant CFM EC motor*


*Notes: <sup>1</sup> The unit is capable of high-low fan performance through the use of a 2-stage thermostat wired to specific terminals for High-Low CFM fan performance. Standard operation with a 1-stage thermostat is indicated as High CFM fan performance.*

*<sup>2</sup>Applications up to 1.0" ESP (in. wg.) are possible. However, increased fan noise should be anticipated and appropriate noise attenuation should be considered.*
