Daikin RAH & RDS air handling equipment trace their history to the late 1970s. With decades of innovation, design flexibility, durable construction, low capitol and operating cost, make RAH and RDS the preferred HVAC solution for thousand of most prominent building projects. RAH & RDS are ideal options for a job where energy efficiency, reliability, indoor air quality and acoustic are top priorities. Along with providing high quality and state-of-the-art technology, RAH & RDS offer the following valuable features and benefits to satisfy a wide range of diverse applications.

Daikin RoofPak air handlers are applicable to schools, offices, shopping centers, manufacturing facilities, etc.

# **Economical First Cost**

Daikin RoofPak air handling units are single-piece construction that reduces field labor, installation time and expense. Units up to 52 feet long are a standard single piece. Units may be split at the Supply Air Fan section bulkhead for convenience in job site handling. Split units are provided with a connection kit for a water-tight joint at the job site.

Individually extensive factory testing and checkout procedures reduce startup and installation expense. An optional valve package† and power package provide complete factory piping and wiring for quick connections. The prefabricated roof curb with integral duct support fits inside the unit base for a leaktight installation that eliminates the need for field-provided duct supports. Lifting brackets in the base channel permit quick, inexpensive rigging.

The high CFM capacity eliminates the need to install two units when one can do the job

# **Energy Efficient System**

The large cross-sectional area of the unit holds static pressure drops to a minimum, reducing fan horsepower requirements. In addition, the entire cabinet is fully insulated to minimize heat loss or gain for overall energy conservation.

To complement the efficient cabinet design, Daikin's patented UltraSeal™ low leak dampers are provided as standard feature. UltraSeal dampers significantly reduce infiltration losses with the lowest leakage rate in the industry (less than 1.5 cfm/ft2 at 1" SP). The hollow core airfoil type damper provides 12 times the insulating factor over flat blade dampers. Operating economy is maximized with available comparative enthalpy control on the economizer cycle† to take full advantage of outside air for cooling.

Airfoil fans provided with a factory-mounted variable frequency drive, with MicroTech® III controls, significantly reducing fan power when applied to variable air volume (VAV) systems.

Our industry leading Protocol Selectability™ feature provides effective BAS selection flexibility. Factory integrated and commissioned MicroTech IIII DDC unit control systems,† eliminate the need for additional cost and time field installation of controls.

Economizers reduce compressor operating hours and energy costs for year-round "free cooling" capability.

# **Improving Indoor Air Quality**

For flexibility in selecting filtration filter, Daikin includes: MERV 8, 11, 13, or 14 options with & without pre-filters. Microbialresistant filters are also an available option. Double-wall panel construction that eliminates fibers in the supply air stream and is easy to clean. Units are provided with double-sloped, galvanized or stainless steel drain pans to eliminate stagnant water and minimize bacterial growth.

# **Quiet System Operation**

Low decibel output is provided by structural quality and specialized design. Units can be equipped with SWSI airfoil plenum fans for excellent acoustics and better efficiency. Supply and return fans are equipped with 200,000 hour greaseable ball bearings for reliable operation.

# **Lower Maintenance Costs**

Service and maintenance are performed out of the occupied space eliminating any inconvenience to the occupants. Control and product reliability functions is designed for single source responsibility and improved reliability.

Units are constructed of pre-painted galvanized steel. Hinged access doors are provided on both sides of each section. This design eliminates the need for stepladders to remove multiple screws common to the access panels used on most competitive rooftop units. Hinges are stainless steel. A single lever roller latching mechanism is located at the unit base to provide easy access. All wiring is in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC). All components are UL listed where applicable. For easy identification, all electrical components are labeled and all wiring is color and number coded. Large, conveniently located control panels with full access doors offer easy servicing of units with the power package. Units also are equipped with a 115-volt outlet located in the main control panel for added convenience. Operating and safety controls are centrally located behind a hinged, deadfront safety panel.

Three-phase factory fusing available for fan motors provides positive protection against damage from short circuits and locked rotor conditions. In addition, phase failure and ground fault protection can be provided. The MicroTech III unit controller provides complete temperature control and, if required, static pressure control for VAV systems.

The MicroTech III control system is provided with a keypad display module mounted in the main control panel for entering set points and unit monitoring.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**Heating and Cooling Coils**

Daikin's ARI certified coils are designed to maximize face area and minimize face velocity, thereby reducing static pressure losses. The Daikin HI-F fin design of RDS/RAH coils provides a substantial improvement to fin efficiency. Design of the HI-F fin produces a state of continuous turbulence that effectively reduces boundary layer formation. As a result, heat transfer efficiency sharply improves, making the HI-F surface an industry leader.

In addition, coil performance is enhanced by the design of staggered tubing. This arrangement exposes the tubes to more moving air than the in-line design, yielding greater heat transfer. The geometry of the staggered tube design also allows the rows to be spaced closer together for a more compact coil.

Daikin offers a broad variety of coil types, fin spacings, row and circuiting combinations, which permits using standard coils to accurately meet load and comfort requirements. Multiple face areas are offered in each cabinet size to allow more selection flexibility.

A standard coil can be selected manually or through the Daikin SelectTools for Contractor Coils selection program to deliver the specified leaving air dry and wet bulb temperatures for virtually any condition. SelectTools offers designers easy and accurate coil selection for optimal performance.

# <span id="page-20-1"></span>**Variable Air Volume**

Daikin RoofPak variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This true variable volume system is commonly referred to as a "squeeze-off" or "pinch-off" system. Unlike a "bypass" or "dump" system, supply air is diverted from areas where it is not required to areas that need cooling and, at system part load conditions, reduces the total fan volume. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lowers system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes.
- Lowers operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions.
- Lowers first cost by reducing space requirements for duct trunks and mechanical equipment.
- Provides system flexibility to match changing occupancy demands.

# **Variable Frequency Drives**†

Variable frequency drives offer reliable operation over a wide range of airflow, with advantages in sound and energy performance.

Variable frequency drives provide the most efficient means of variable volume control by taking advantage of the fan law relation between fan speed (rpm) and fan brake horsepower (bhp). Also, since airflow is reduced by changing fan speed, the noise penalties often associated with mechanical control devices, e.g. inlet vanes, are not introduced. The following equation illustrates how fan bhp varies as the cube of the change in fan speed:

$$
\hbar \mathfrak{p}\_2 = \hbar \mathfrak{p}\_1 \left( \frac{\mathsf{density}\_2}{\mathsf{density}\_1} \right) \left( \frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1} \right)^3

In an ideal system, at 50% fan speed, brake horsepower would be reduced to 12.5% of that at full speed.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>Variable frequency control varies the speed of the fan by adjusting the frequency and voltage to the motor.

#### *Figure 27: Variable frequency drive control*

# **Airfoil Fans**

To further enhance VAV system performance, Daikin RoofPak VAV systems use efficient airfoil fan selections.

Daikin airfoil fan selections feature:

- Higher operating efficiencies than with commonly used, forward curved fans, reducing system energy demands and electrical requirements.
- A non-overloading brake horsepower curve.
- A single wheel design, eliminating potential problems with fan paralleling at light loads.

# **MicroTech III VAV Fan Tracking Control**†

A key element in successful VAV application is the ability to track supply and return air fan volumes so that proper building static pressure is maintained. Daikin, a pioneer in the development of rooftop VAV systems, developed its exclusive VaneTrol fan tracking control logic to solve this issue. Incorporating over 35 years of rooftop VAV system experience, the latest generation MicroTech III controls with VaneTrol logic provide advanced and accurate duct static pressure control plus supply and return fan tracking control that effectively and efficiently manages building static pressure.

The MicroTech III controller provides complete control of your variable frequency drive applications.

# **Static Pressure Sensing Locations**

In placing a duct static pressure sensor, locate a pressure tap near the end of the main duct trunk. Adjust the static pressure control so that at minimum airflow all the terminals receive the minimum static pressure required plus any downstream resistance. Locate a pressure tap in the ductwork free from turbulent effect, at least ten duct diameters downstream and several duct diameters upstream from any major interference including branch takeoffs. Do not sense the static in a branch duct. On installations having multiple duct trunks, multiple floors, or widely varying zones (e.g. east/west), use optional second sensor.

### *MicroTech III Controls*

MicroTech III unit control systems are preengineered, preprogrammed, and factory tested prior to shipment. These components include:

- Unit controller with user interface display and navigation wheel
- Optional expansion modules
- Communication module (optional)
- Pressure transducers
- Unit-mounted temperature sensors
- Zone temperature sensor packages
- Humidity sensor

### <span id="page-21-1"></span>*Open Choices Benefits for Easy Integration*

- Easy, low cost integration into most building automation systems without costly gateway panels.
- Flexibility to select either BACnet or LonWorks communication. Units are LonMark 3.4 certified with the appropriate communications module for LonWorks networks.
- Comprehensive unit control and status information is available at the BAS regardless of communication protocol.
- Long-term choices for equipment adds or replacements, and for service support.
- Flexible alarm notification and prioritization with Intrinsic Alarm Management (BACnet).
- Simplified BAS integration with the ability to set network parameters at the unit controller, reducing installation time and costs.
- Easy monitoring and troubleshooting of communication status from the unit controller to the BAS.

### *MicroTech III Unit Controller*

The unit controller is preprogrammed with the software necessary to control the unit. Use the unit controller keypad display to keep schedules, set points and parameters from being lost, even during a long-term power outage. The unit controller processes system input data and then determines and controls output responses. An optional field- or factorymounted BACnet or LonWorks communication module provides a network interface to the BAS.

### *Expansion Modules*

These boards are used to expand the input and output capability of the unit controller. Each board communicates via serial data communications. These microprocessor based boards provide independent operation and alarm response even if communication is lost with the unit controller.

### *Communication Module*

An optional communication module provides the means to factory or field configure MicroTech III unit controls for interoperability with an independent BAS. Communication modules are available to support industry recognized communication protocols including BACnet MS/TP, BACnet/IP and LonWorks.

### *Keypad/Display*

All MicroTech III unit controllers include a push/pull navigation wheel and display. The display is a supertwist nematic type with highly visible black characters on a yellow background. The 5-line by 22-character format allows for easy to understand plain English display messages. All operating conditions, system alarms, control parameters and schedules can be monitored from the keypad/display. If the correct password has been entered, any adjustable parameter or schedule can be modified from the keypad.

#### *Figure 28: Open Choices Integration*

22------------------------------------------------



### *Figure 29: MicroTech III Keypad/Display*

### *Temperature and Humidity Sensors*

With the exception of the zone sensor, all temperature sensors are factory installed and tested. Zone sensor packages are available to suit any application. When required for dehumidification applications, a humidity sensor is available for field installation.

### *Static Pressure Transducers*

All pressure transducers are factory installed and tested. Connection and routing of field-supplied sampling tubes is done at time of unit installation.

### **Zone Temperature Sensors**

Two optional zone temperature sensors are available:

- Zone sensor with tenant override switch.
- Zone sensor with tenant override switch and remote set point adjustment.

Timed tenant override is a standard MicroTech III control feature.

Zone sensors are required for the controller's purge cycle, space reset of supply air set point, and night setback or setup features. All zone sensors are field installed with field wiring terminated at a separate, clearly marked terminal strip.

# **Stand-alone Controller Features**

MicroTech III applied rooftop unit controls include all of the essential features required to make them capable of completely independent, stand-alone operation.

### *Internal Time Clock*

An internal, battery-backed time clock is included in the MicroTech III unit controller. Current date and time can be quickly and easily set at the user interface keypad.

### *Internal Schedule*

Seven daily schedules and one holiday schedule can be entered at the keypad of all unit controllers. For each of these eight schedules, one start and one stop time can be entered. Up to 10 holiday periods, of any duration, can be designated. The unit will automatically run according to the holiday schedule on the holiday dates. To handle special occasions, an additional 'one event' schedule can also be used.

In lieu of its internal schedule, the unit can be operated according to a network schedule from a BAS.

### *External Time Clock or Tenant Override Input*

An input is supplied that can be used to accept a field wired start/stop signal from a remote source. An external time clock, a tenant override switch, or both may be connected. Whenever the external circuit is closed, the controller overrides the internal schedule (if activated) and places the unit into the occupied mode.

If the internal schedule or a BAS network schedule is used, field wiring is not required.

### *Timed Tenant Override*

Off-hour operation flexibility is a must in today's office environments and even stand-alone MicroTech III controls handle it with ease. When unit operation is desired during unoccupied hours, initiate timed tenant override by pressing the tenant override button on either of the optional zone sensor packages. The unit then starts and runs in the occupied mode for a keypad-adjustable length of time (up to five hours). If the button is pressed again while the unit is operating, the timer resets to the full time allowance without interrupting unit operation. Tenant override operation also can be initiated by a BAS.

23------------------------------------------------



### *Three Remote Set Point Adjustment Options*

- 1. Remote user interface option (RUI). See [Variable Air](#page-20-1)  [Volume on page 21.](#page-20-1)
- 2. Building automation system (BAS). See [Open Choices](#page-21-1)  [Benefits for Easy Integration on page 22](#page-21-1).
- 3. All constant air volume-zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC) unit controllers include an input that can be used to remotely adjust the zone cooling and heating set points. To use this feature, wire the optional zone sensor package with set point adjustment to the controller. The remote set point adjustment feature can be enabled or disabled from the keypad at any time. When enabled, remote set point adjustment is available even if the return temperature is selected to be the Control Temperature.

### *Auto/Manual Operation Selection*

Automatic or manual operation can be controlled either remotely or at the keypad.

All controllers include three inputs that can be used to enable or disable cooling, heating, and fan operation from remote switches. With the "heat enable" and "cool enable" terminals, the operator can enable cooling, heating, or both as desired. Using the system "off" terminals, the operator can disable the fans, and thus the entire unit.

From the keypad, there are a variety of occupancy and auto/ manual control mode selections available to the operator:

- Occupancy modes
	- Auto
	- Occupied
	- Unoccupied
	- Bypass (tenant override)
- Control modes
	- Off manual
	- Auto
	- Heat/cool
	- Cool only
	- Heat only
	- Fan only

### *Economizer Changeover Selection*

On units equipped with an economizer, there are three methods of determining whether the outdoor air is suitable for free cooling: two methods sense enthalpy (dry bulb temperature and humidity) and one senses outdoor air dry bulb temperature.

The two enthalpy changeover methods use external, factory installed controls. One compares the outdoor ambient enthalpy to a set point; the other is a solid state device that compares the outdoor ambient enthalpy to the return air enthalpy. This comparative enthalpy control can improve total economizer performance.

All unit controls include an internal dry bulb changeover strategy that can be selected at the keypad. When this method is selected, the controller compares the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature to a keypad programmable set point. The external enthalpy control input is then ignored.

### *Cooling and Heating Lockout Control*

All unit controls include separate keypad programmable set points for locking out mechanical cooling and heating. Mechanical cooling is locked out when the outdoor temperature is below the cooling lockout set point; heating is locked out when the outdoor temperature is above the heating lockout set point. This feature can save energy cost by eliminating unnecessary heating and cooling during warm-up or cool-down periods or when the outdoor air temperature is mild.

### *Night Setback and Setup Control*

When one of the zone temperature sensors is connected to the unit controller, night setback heating and night setup cooling control are available. Separate, keypad programmable night heating and cooling set points are used to start the unit when necessary. After the unit starts, night setback and setup control is similar to normal occupied control except that the minimum outside air damper position is set to zero. If the outside air is suitable for free cooling, it is used during night setup operation.

Except for 100% outside air applications, night setback control is available even if the unit is not equipped with any heating equipment. When the space temperature falls to the night setback set point, the fans simply start and run until the temperature rises above the differential. This feature might be useful for applications that use, for example, duct-mounted reheat coils.

24------------------------------------------------



### *Morning Warm-up Control*

If the Control Temperature (space or return) is below set point when the unit enters the occupied mode, the morning warm-up control function will keep the outside air dampers closed while heat is supplied to satisfy set point. The outside air damper will remain closed until either the space temperature rises to the heating set point or the keypad adjustable morning warm-up timer expires (default is 90 minutes). The morning warm-up timer supplies the minimum required amount of outdoor air after a certain time regardless of the space temperature.

Morning warm-up control is automatically included on all except 100% outside air units. It is available even if the unit is not equipped with any heating equipment, for applications that utilize, for example, duct-mounted reheat coils.

### *Proportional Integral (PI) Control*

The Proportional Integral (PI) control algorithm controls modulating actuators to maintain a measured variable (temperature or pressure) at or near its set point. For example, it controls economizer dampers to maintain the discharge cooling set point and it controls the supply fan variable frequency drives to maintain the duct static pressure set point. The integral control feature effectively eliminates "proportional droop" (load dependent offset) resulting in the tightest possible control.

For each PI loop, four keypad adjustable parameters allow the control loop to be properly tuned for any application:

- Period
- Dead band
- Proportional band
- Integral time

Appropriate default values for these parameters are loaded into each controller. These default values will provide proper control for most applications; therefore, field tuning is usually not required and thus start-up time is reduced.

### *Change Algorithm*

The PI function is also used to adjust set points instead of controlling variable speed drives or actuators directly. For example, in zone control applications, the PI loop automatically "changes" the discharge temperature set point (cooling or heating) as the Control Temperature deviates from the zone set point. Another PI loop then controls the economizer actuator or heating valve actuator using the current discharge temperature set point. Unlike a typical "master-submaster" reset strategy, this "cascade control" continuously adjusts the discharge set point, even if the Control Temperature's deviation from set point remains constant. This means that the unit's cooling or heating output is set according to the actual load, not just the current zone temperature. The tightest possible zone temperature control results because "proportional droop" (load dependent offset) is eliminated.

### *Calibrate*

When initiated at the keypad by an operator, the Calibrate function automatically calibrates all actuator position feedback inputs and all pressure transducer inputs. It does this by shutting the unit down and then driving all actuators to the full closed and full open positions. The controller records the input voltage values that correspond to these positions. The pressure transducer input voltages, which are assumed for 0.00-in. W.C., are also recorded. When Calibrate is finished, enter an operator command at the keypad to start the unit.

### *Field Output Signals*

All MicroTech III RoofPak controls include two solid-state relay outputs that are available for field connection to any suitable device: the remote alarm output and the occupied output. These two outputs are used to signal field equipment of unit status.

### *Remote Alarm Output:*

The remote alarm output can be used to operate a 24 volt relay to provide a remote alarm signal to a light, audible alarm, or other device when an alarm condition exists at the unit.

### *Fan Operation Output:*

The fan operation output is used to operate a 24 volt relay to control field equipment that depends on fan operation; for instance, to open field installed isolation dampers or VAV boxes. To allow actuators enough time to stroke, the fan operation output is energized three minutes before the fans start. It then remains energized until thirty seconds after the unit airflow switch senses no airflow. The fan operation output is on whenever the unit airflow switch senses airflow.

### *Standard Control Options*

Applied rooftop systems are available for most any constant or variable air volume application. MicroTech III controls offer three basic control configurations: variable air volume with discharge temperature control (VAV-DTC), constant air volume with zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC), and constant air volume with discharge temperature control (CAV-DTC), that use sophisticated state change control logic to provide stable, reliable and efficient control. When combined with MicroTech III's many available control capabilities, both factory installed and keypad programmable, these three basic configurations can be customized to meet the requirements of the most demanding applications.

### *Variable Air Volume with Discharge Temperature Control (VAV)*

All VAV units provide true discharge temperature control in addition to duct static pressure control. Cooling only, cooling with single-stage "morning warm-up" heat, and cooling with modulating heat configurations are available. On units with a return fan, two building static pressure control options are available: VaneTrol™ logic tracking or direct building pressure control. Because proper ventilation rates have been identified as critical to maintaining good indoor air quality, all RoofPak VAV controllers include software algorithms designed to maintain minimum outside air volume at all times when the unit is in the Occupied mode.

### *Constant Air Volume with Zone Temperature Control (CAV-ZTC)*

CAV-ZTC units are available in either cooling only or cooling with modulating heat configurations. Either of these configurations is available for 100% recirculated, mixed, or 100% outdoor air applications. On units that have a return fan, a direct building static pressure control option is also available.

### *Constant Air Volume with Discharge Temperature Control (CAV-DTC)*

CAV-DTC units are available in cooling only, cooling with single-stage "morning warm-up" heat, or cooling with modulating heat configurations. This unit configuration can be used for applications that have zone controlled terminal reheat coils or for constant volume, 100% outdoor air applications. The discharge temperature control strategies used with the hybrid CAV-DTC unit are identical to those used with the VAVDTC unit. On units that have a return fan, a direct building static pressure control option is available (constant supply air volume applications only).

### *Discharge Temperature Control*

MicroTech III VAV-DTC and CAV-DTC controls provide sophisticated and flexible discharge air temperature control that is only possible with DDC systems. Separate discharge air temperature set points are used for cooling and modulating heating control. At the keypad, the operator can either enter the desired set points or select separate reset methods and parameters for each set point (see [Supply Air](#page-26-0)  [Reset on page 27](#page-26-0)).

### *Control Temperature*

The Control Temperature makes the heat/cool changeover decision. It determines whether cooling or heating is enabled; the discharge temperature then determines whether cooling or heating is actually supplied. At the keypad, the operator can choose the source of the Control Temperature from among the following selections.

- Space temperature sensor
- Return temperature sensor
- Outside air temperature sensor (modulating heat only)
- Network communication

The operator enters separate cool and heat enable set points and deadbands that the Control Temperature is compared with (see [Figure 30](#page-25-0)). When the Control Temperature is greater than or equal to the cooling set point plus DB/2, cooling is enabled. When the Control Temperature is less than or equal to the heat set point minus DB/2, heating is enabled. If desired, these set points and differentials can be set so that there is a dead band in which both cooling and heating are disabled. The controller's software prevents simultaneous cooling and heating.

### <span id="page-25-0"></span>*Figure 30: Control Temperature Logic*

26------------------------------------------------



### <span id="page-26-0"></span>*Supply Air Reset*

By automatically varying the discharge air temperature to suit a building's cooling or heating needs, supply air temperature reset can increase the energy efficiency of VAV and CAV-DTC systems. MicroTech III controllers offer a variety of different reset strategies that can be selected at the keypad. Because they are keypad programmable, reset strategies can be changed or eliminated as desired. Separate strategies can be selected for both cooling and modulating heat. If reset is not desired, a fixed discharge cooling or heating set point can be entered.

The following reset methods are available:

- Space temperature
- Return temperature
- Outdoor air temperature
- Supply airflow (VAV, cooling set point only)
- External 0–10 VDC or 0–20 mA signal
- Network communication

For all temperature reset methods, the minimum and maximum cooling and heating set points are keypad programmable along with the corresponding minimum and maximum space, return or outdoor air temperature parameters. For the supply airflow method, the discharge set point will be reset as the supply fan modulates between 30% adjustable and 100% adjustable. For the external method, the discharge set point will be reset as the voltage or current signal varies over its entire range. For units in a BAS network, the discharge set points are reset via the communication signal.

### *Zone Temperature Control*

MicroTech III CAV-ZTC controls provide the sophisticated and flexible zone temperature control that is only possible with DDC systems. Zone temperature sensors are available with or without a remote set point adjustment. With the remote adjustment model, the space set point can be set at the keypad or at the zone sensor package. Even if a zone sensor is connected, remote set point adjustment can be enabled or disabled as desired at the keypad.

### *Control Temperature*

The Control Temperature is the representative zone temperature. When compared with the zone set points, the Control Temperature determines whether the unit supplies heating, cooling, or neither. It also determines the amount of cooling or heating required to satisfy the load. Its source can be selected at the keypad from among the following selections:

- Zone temperature sensor
- Return temperature sensor

Because it is the representative zone temperature, the Control Temperature is the primary input to the MicroTech III zone temperature control algorithms. Control Temperature parameters are described below. The controller's software will prevent cooling and heating from being inadvertently enabled at the same time.

### *Project Ahead Algorithm*

Because the inherent lag effect in zone temperature control applications can cause overshoot during warm-up or cooldown periods, MicroTech III features a "Project Ahead" control algorithm. Project Ahead calculates the rate at which the Control Temperature is changing and reduces the unit's cooling or heating output as the zone temperature nears its set point, essentially eliminating overshoot.

# **Duct Static Pressure Control**

On all VAV-DTC units, duct static pressure control is maintained by the PI algorithm, which provides precise control of the supply fan variable speed drive. The keypad programmable set point can be set between 0.20-in. W.C. and 4.00-in. W.C.

On larger buildings with multiple floors, multiple trunk runs or large shifts in load due to solar effects (east/west building orientation), an optional second duct static sensor is offered. The MicroTech III controller automatically selects and uses the lower of the two sensed pressures to control fan volume to provide adequate static pressure to the most demanding space at all times.

# **Building Static Pressure Control**

### *VaneTrol™ Fan Tracking Control (does not apply to exhaust fans)*

VaneTrol fan tracking control logic offers close and reliable building static pressure control for VAV units equipped with a return air fan. With the VaneTrol logic method, the return fan's variable speed drive assembly tracks the supply fan volume as the supply fan maintains the required duct static pressure using the additional parameter of maintaining a field programmable offset between supply fan and return fan volume. The result is that building pressure is maintained, regardless of the building cooling load, because the proper relationship between supply and return fan volume is maintained. Because the return fan/ supply fan tracking relationship is established once during controlled test-and-balance conditions, ongoing building pressure control is not affected by a fluctuating ambient pressure reference signal or the temporary effects of opening and closing doors on a pressure sensor in the lobby.

VaneTrol control logic uses four keypad programmable parameters to maintain the required relationship between return fan and supply fan volumes. These are the supply and corresponding return fan volumes as measured by variable speed drive position, at both maximum and minimum airflow conditions.

[Table 3](#page-27-0) shows an example of how supply and return air fan modulation must vary to maintain the correct balance of supply and return air volumes based on the building's parameters and therefore maintain building pressure. Determining the building's correct VaneTrol parameters is easy with MicroTech III's Balance feature. With Balance, start-up time is reduced because final adjustments are made at the keypad.

<span id="page-27-0"></span>



### *Direct Space Pressure Control (for return or exhaust fans)*

Any constant or variable air volume unit equipped with a variable volume return or exhaust fan can be provided with direct building static pressure control capability. With the direct method, building static pressure is measured and processed by the PI algorithm. This algorithm provides precise control of the return fan variable speed drive or inlet vanes to maintain the space pressure set point. The range of the keypad programmable set point is between minus 0.25-in. W.C. and 0.25-in. W.C.

This type of control can be used for either whole building or lab pressurization (positive or negative) applications, or exhaust fan control where VaneTrol control logic does not apply.

## **Minimum Ventilation Air Volume Control**

Consistently maintaining the minimum outdoor air requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62 has been a long standing control challenge for VAV systems. As supply air fan volumes were reduced, the volume of air introduced through a fixed position, minimum outdoor air damper was also reduced, compromising indoor air quality. To meet this challenge, MicroTech III controls feature four user-selected control methods for maintaining outdoor air volume.

- The MicroTech III controller can accept a signal from a DesignFlow Precision Ventilation Air Control System, which is continuously measuring outdoor air volume, and adjust outdoor air damper position to maintain the minimum volume set point.
- MicroTech III controls have a keypad selected control function that automatically adjusts outdoor air damper position in response to changes in supply air fan volume. Regardless of supply air volume, this strategy maintains a nearly constant outdoor air volume at all times.The MicroTech III controller can accept an external 0–10 VDC signal from a CO2 sensor or other control device and adjust outdoor air damper position.
- If desired, a fixed minimum damper position can be keypad programmed. This selection may be acceptable when ventilation requirements are met through other sources.

During cold ambient conditions where outdoor/return mixed air conditions can become too low, MicroTech III controls maintain the cooling discharge temperature set point by controlling the unit heating system. For applications where ambient temperatures and minimum outdoor air requirements can generate this condition, order the RoofPak unit with modulating heating equipment, such as the SuperMod gas burner.

[Table 4](#page-27-1) illustrates the effect of minimum ventilation control and cold ambient conditions on unit discharge air temperature and how it dictates the need for mixed air tempering capability at the light load/low ambient conditions. It assumes a VAV unit with a 20% outdoor air requirement at design conditions and a 40% minimum airflow requirement.

28------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-28-0"></span><span id="page-28-1"></span>**Application Considerations**

The following section contains basic application and installation guidelines that must be considered as part of the detailed analysis of any specific project.

# **General**

Units are intended for use in normal heating, ventilating and air conditioning applications. Consult your local Daikin Applied sales representative for applications involving operation at high ambient temperatures, high altitudes, non-cataloged voltages and for applications requiring modified or special control sequences. Consult your local Daikin Applied sales representative for job specific unit selections that fall outside of the range of the catalog tables, such as 100% outside air applications.

For proper operation, units should be rigged in accordance with instructions stated in IM 485. Fire dampers, if required, must be installed in the ductwork according to local or state codes. No space is allowed for these dampers in the unit. Follow factory check, test and start procedures explicitly to achieve satisfactory start-up and operation (see IM 485).

# **Unit Location**

The structural engineer must verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Take extreme caution when using a wooden roof structure.

Locate the unit fresh air intakes away from building flue stacks or exhaust ventilators to reduce possible reintroduction of contaminated air to the system. Unit condenser coils should be located to avoid contact with any heated exhaust air.

Allow sufficient space around the unit for maintenance/service clearance as well as to allow for full outside air intake and removal of exhaust air. Refer to [Recommended Clearances on](#page-95-1)  [page 96](#page-95-1) for recommended clearances. Consult your Daikin Applied sales representative if available clearances do not meet minimum recommendations. Where code considerations, such as the NEC, require extended clearances, they take precedence.

# **Split Units**

Units may sometimes have to be split into multiple pieces to accommodate shipping limitations or jobsite lifting limitations. Units exceeding 52 feet in length may need to be split for shipping purposes. Units exceeding the rating of an available crane or helicopter may also need to be split for rigging purposes. Unit can be split between the supply fan and heat section. Contact your local Daikin sales representative for more details.

# **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16 in per foot side to side). A sub-base has to be constructed by the contractor in applications involving pitched roofs. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. Typical curb installation is illustrated in [Section Options and](#page-78-1)  [Locations—RDS 708B on page 79.](#page-78-1) In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side.

Applications in geographic areas that are subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

When curbs are installed on a built-up roof with metal decking, provide an inverted 6-in channel on both sides of the unit. Install acoustical material over the decking, inside the roof curb. Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking. Apply appropriate acoustical and vibration design practices during the early stages of design to provide noise compatibility with the intended use of the space. Consult your Daikin sales representative for unit sound power data.

# **Acoustical Considerations**

Good acoustical design is a critical part of any installation and should start at the earliest stages in the design process. Each of the four common sound paths for rooftop equipment must be addressed. These are:

- Radiated sound through the bottom of the unit and into the space
- Structure-borne vibration from the unit to the building
- Airborne sound through the supply air duct
- Airborne sound through the return air duct

Locating rooftop equipment away from sound sensitive areas is critical and the most cost-effective means of avoiding sound problems. If possible, always locate rooftop equipment be over less sensitive areas such as corridors, toilet facilities or auxiliary spaces and away from office areas, conference rooms and classrooms.

29------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-29-0"></span>Some basic guidelines for good acoustical performance are:

- Always provide proper structural support under all areas of the unit.
- Always locate the unit's center of gravity close to a main support to minimize roof deflection. Maintaining a roof deflection under 1/3 in minimizes vibration-induced noise.
- Use a concrete deck or pad when a unit has to be located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential.
- Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking within the curb perimeter; seal the openings once the duct is installed.
- Don't overlook the return air path. Never leave a clear "line of sight" into a return or exhaust fan; always include some duct work (acoustically lined tee) at the return inlet.
- Minimize system static pressure losses to reduce fan sound generation.
- Select the appropriate fan for the application. Select fans as close as possible to their peak static efficiency. Peak static efficiency is identified by the first system curve to the right of the shaded "Do not select" region, as illustrated in [Figure 31](#page-29-1).
- Design duct systems to minimize turbulence.
- Account for low frequency duct breakout in system design. Route the first 20 ft of rectangular duct over non-sensitive areas and avoid large duct aspect ratios. Consider round or oval duct to reduce breakout.
- When an added measure of airborne fan sound control is required, sound attenuators can be supplied, factory installed in a unit discharge air section, to treat the supply fan. On the return side, additional attenuation can often be achieved by routing the return duct within the curb area beneath the unit.

There are many sound sources in rooftop systems. Fans, duct take-offs, etc. all generate sound. For guidelines on reducing sound generation in the duct system, refer to the 2003 ASHRAE Applications Handbook, Chapter 47.

Contact your local Daikin sales representative for equipment supply, return and radiated sound power data specific to your application.

# **Ductwork**

A well-designed duct system is required to allow the rooftop equipment to provide rated performance and to minimize system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow transitions. Avoid any abrupt change in duct size and sharp turns in the fan discharge. Avoid turns opposed to wheel rotation since they generate air turbulence and result in unwanted sound. If 90° turns are necessary, use turning vanes. Refer to the 2003 ASHRAE Applications Handbook, Chapter 47 for specific guidelines relevant to rooftop equipment.

### *Figure 31: Optimal fan selection line*

<span id="page-29-1"></span># **Return Duct**

The return path is the most often overlooked. A section of return duct is required to avoid a "line of sight" to the return air opening and to provide attenuation of return air sound. Install an insulated tee with a maximum duct velocity of 1000 to 1200 feet per minute. Extend the duct 15 feet to provide adequate attenuation.

# **Supply Duct**

Insulate supply air ductwork for at least the first 20 feet from the unit. Consider using round or oval ductwork since it significantly reduces low frequency breakout noise near the equipment. If rectangular duct is used, keep the aspect ratio of the duct as low as possible. The large flat surfaces associated with high aspect ratios increase low frequency breakout to the space and can generate noise, such as "oil canning." The maximum recommended supply duct velocity is 1800 to 2000 feet per minute.

30------------------------------------------------



# **Duct High Limit**

All Daikin RoofPak systems with VAV control include an adjustable duct high limit switch as a standard feature. This is of particular importance when fast acting, normally closed boxes are used. The switch is field adjustable and must be set to meet the specific rating of the system ductwork.

# **Vibration Isolation**

Make duct attachments to the unit with a flexible connection.

# **Economizer, Return Fan, and Exhaust Fan Application**

### *(Exhaust fan not available on size 708)*

Rooftop economizer applications usually require return or exhaust fans to properly control building pressure and maintain minimum ventilation. Daikin offers both exhaust and return fan capability. They usually are not interchangeable for a given design. In general:

- Use return air fans (RAF) on ducted return systems (return ESP exceeds 0.4" to 0.5").
- Properly selected propeller exhaust air fans (EAF) can operate successfully and save energy on open return systems (return ESP is less than 0.4" to 0.5").
- Supply air fan (SAF) selection depends on whether a return or exhaust fan is used.
- RAF system-SAF handles only the supply ESP at design.
- EAF system-SAF handles both the supply and return ESP at design (EAF is off).

[Figure 32](#page-30-0) illustrates why supply fan only units can have problems, especially as return ESP increases.

- No exhaust occurs from the rooftop because the economizer section must be at a negative pressure.
- <span id="page-30-0"></span>• The air balancer must adjust the outdoor air damper to generate large pressure drops at minimum ventilation settings (about 0.9" in [Figure 32](#page-30-0)).

#### *Figure 32: Supply air fan only system static pressures with 1" return duct ESP*

[Figure 33](#page-30-1) illustrates how adding a return fan corrects these problems. The return fan is responsible for return system ESP and maintains a slightly positive pressure in the economizer section (about +0.1" in [Figure 33](#page-30-1)) to allow for exhaust air control and a more suitable outside air intake pressure.

#### <span id="page-30-1"></span>*Figure 33: RAF system allows proper exhaust and outdoor air control*

31------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-31-0"></span>Exhaust fans are very different than return fans and cannot maintain proper building pressure and ventilation control as return ESP increases.

- The EAF is normally off during non-economizer operation. During these minimum outdoor air conditions, the system essentially acts like a supply fan only system.
- When the exhaust fan cycles off, there is no device available to maintain a positive pressure for relief, the mixed air plenum pressure dramatically changes, and minimum ventilation air control and space pressure are lost.

An exhaust fan's performance weaknesses diminish as return ESP decreases. Properly selected and controlled propeller exhaust fans can successfully operate and save energy at reduced return ESP designs.

- At system operating conditions where a single fan can be used successfully, it generally is more efficient than operating series fans under the same total load. When the exhaust fan turns off, the supply fan handles both the supply and return duct loads more efficiently.
- At the relatively high cfm, low static pressure conditions of exhaust/return application, exhaust fans can be selected closer to their peak design efficiency than can full return fans. This allows them to run more efficiently throughout their operating range.

Therefore, when return duct losses don't dictate using a return air fan, exhaust fans are an efficient alternative.

# **Smoke and Fire Protection**

Daikin optionally offers factory-installed outdoor air, return air, and exhaust air dampers as well as smoke detectors in the supply and return air opening, complete with wiring and control. These components often are used in the building's smoke, fume, and fire protection systems. However, due to the wide variation in building design and ambient operating conditions into which our units are applied, we do not represent or warrant that our products are fit and sufficient for smoke, fume, and fire control purposes. The owner and a fully qualified building designer are responsible for meeting all local and NFPA building code requirements with respect to smoke, fume, and fire control. Daikin offers the flexibility to offer these various components and control sequences, as directed by the customer, to help meet code requirements.

# **Filters**

# **General**

Routinely replace filters to minimize filter loading. As filters get dirty, the filter pressure drop increases, causing a decrease in airflow. Depending on fan type, forward curved or airfoil, this airflow change can be significant. The effect of filter loading is the most critical when using 65% and 95% efficient filters.

When making a fan selection, include a pressure drop component in the system total static pressure for filters since they get dirty. Generally, select a value midway between clean and dirty filter ratings. If a minimum airflow is critical, the fan selection should be made using the higher, dirty filter pressure drop value. Following these recommendations should limit airflow fluctuation as the filters load.

# **Final Filters**

The application of final filters (filters downstream of the fan) places special requirements on unit selection. When final filters are employed, cooling coils must be located in the drawthrough position so that the filters will not be in a saturated air stream. Also, final filters applications for a unit with gas heat requires the filters to be rated for 500°F. Instruct maintenance personnel to use properly rated replacement filters.

# **Variable Air Volume Application**

RoofPak units are available with variable speed drives to provide variable air volume (VAV) control. Refer to [Variable Air](#page-20-1)  [Volume on page 21](#page-20-1) for further information on VAV systems.

In placing a duct static pressure sensor, locate a pressure tap near the end of the main duct trunk. Adjust the static pressure set point so that at minimum airflow all of the terminals receive the minimum static pressure required plus any downstream resistance. Locate the static pressure sensor tap in the ductwork in an area free from turbulence effects and at least ten duct diameters downstream and several duct diameters upstream from any major interference, including branch takeoffs. A second sensor is available and should be used on installations having multiple duct trunks, multiple floors, or significantly varying zones (e.g., east/west). The MicroTech III controller will control the variable speed drive to satisfy the supply duct requiring the most static pressure.

# **Multiple Air Handler Control**

For applications in which multiple units are connected in a common duct system, it is important to control all units from a common duct static pressure sensor and to control all operating units in unison. Centralized duct static pressure control can be accomplished through communication with the BAS network or the Daikin MicroTech Integrated Control System (see brochure [ASP 31-260](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)).

32------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Fan Operating Range**

The acceptable system operating range of the Daikin rooftop is determined by all of the following characteristics. Each of these limiting factors must be considered for proper performance and component design life.

- Unstable fan operation
- Maximum fan rpm
- Maximum cabinet static pressure
- Maximum face velocity (cooling coil is most important)
- Minimum furnace or electric heater velocity
- Turndown capability on VAV applications

[Figure 34](#page-32-1) illustrates these limiting factors with exception of the last two items. The shaded area indicates the design operating range of the fan. For optimal efficiency, select fans as close to the fan's peak static efficiency line as possible. This line is the first system curve to the right of the unstable line illustrated.

### *Figure 34: Fan selection boundary*

<span id="page-32-1"></span># **Fan Isolation**

All Daikin RoofPak systems feature internally isolated fans. All supply and return air fans are statically and dynamically balanced in the factory and mounted on rubber-in-shear (RIS) or 2-in deflection spring isolators. Flexible isolation is provided as standard between the fan outlet and the discharge bulkhead to prevent hard contact and vibration transmission. Spring isolated fan assemblies also are available with seismic restraints.

The choice of 2-in deflection spring isolation or RIS isolation depends on an analysis of the roof structure and whether or not an isolation curb is being provided. When using an isolation curb, consult with the curb manufacturer before selecting spring isolation in the rooftop unit. Doubling or "stacking" spring isolation can generate a resonant vibration.

# <span id="page-32-3"></span>**Indoor Fan and Motor Heat, Blowthrough vs. Draw-through Cooling**

Daikin offers blow-through and draw-through cooling coils so the unit can be best selected to match job requirements. (Blowthrough coils not available on size 708.)

# **Indoor fan and motor heat.**

- The indoor fan and motor electrical consumption is a sensible cooling load approximately equal to 2.8 MBh per BHP (depending slightly on motor efficiency). This occurs at the fan. See [Figure 35](#page-32-2) and [Figure 36.](#page-33-1) The fan and motor preheat the mixed air before it enters a blowthrough cooling coil. The fan and motor reheat the air leaving a draw-through cooling coil. Refer also to 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook, Chapter 31.
- Fan and motor temperature rise is equal to Btuh/(1.08 × cfm) and is typically about 3°F.
- Due to fan and motor heat placement ([Figure 35](#page-32-2)), blowthrough coils provide a high sensible heat ratio while draw-through coils provide more latent cooling per total ton. Blow-through coils achieve a higher sensible heat ratio because they operate with a higher coil approach temperature and a lower entering relative humidity. Conversely, draw-through coils cool air at a lower approach temperature and a higher relative humidity, increasing latent cooling.
- Blow-through coils effectively provide colder supply air temperatures per ton of air conditioning and greater sensible heat ratio. This potentially allows a significant reduction in design cfm for buildings with high sensible heat ratios and a resulting reduction in building energy use.

### <span id="page-33-1"></span><span id="page-33-0"></span>*Figure 36: Blow-through vs. draw-through performance*

# **Draw-through (available on all units)**

In a draw-through unit, the fan is located after the cooling coil. In this arrangement, fan heat is applied as reheat to the cold, conditioned air coming off of the coil. This arrangement has a lower sensible heat ratio and higher dehumidification capability than a blow-through coil arrangement. Draw-through arrangements are well suited for 100% outside air applications and applications needing more dehumidification. A drawthrough arrangement is mandatory for all applications requiring final filters. The discharge temperature available to the supply duct is always the sum of the coil leaving air temperature plus the fan temperature rise. This must be considered when selecting the supply air volume required to satisfy space requirements.

### **Example:**

*55°F leaving coil temperature + 3°F fan temp. rise = 58°F discharge air temperature*

# **Blow-through (not available on size 708)**

In a blow-through unit, the fan is located before the DX cooling coil. In this arrangement, fan heat is applied as preheat to the coil. Preheating the air lowers its relative humidity, giving this arrangement a high sensible heat ratio. Blowthrough arrangements are well suited for comfort conditioning applications where space heat gains are primarily sensible and the primary latent load is from ventilation air. The discharge temperature available to the supply duct is the coil leaving air temperature.

# <span id="page-33-3"></span>**Altitude Adjustments**

Fan curve performance is based on 70°F air temperature and sea level elevation. Selections at any other conditions require the following adjustment for air densities listed in Table 6. Higher elevations generally require more rpm to provide a given static pressure but less bhp due to the decrease in air density.

- 1. Assume 32,000 cfm is required at 3.11" TSP. The elevation is 5000 ft and 70°F average air temperature is selected. A 40" DWDI airfoil fan is selected.
- 2. The density adjustment factor for 5000 ft and 70°F is 0.83.
- 3. TSP must be adjusted as follows: 3.11" / 0.83 = 3.75".
- 4. Locate 32,000 cfm and 3.75 on the fan curve. Rpm = 900 and bhp = 27.5. The required fan speed is 900 rpm.
- 5. The consumed fan power at design = 27.5 bph × 0.83 = 22.8 bhp.


#### <span id="page-33-2"></span>*Table 5: Temperature and altitude conversion factors*

# **Furnace Performance**

Gas heat performance data is based on standard 70°F air temperature and zero feet altitude (sea level). For altitudes of 2000 feet and higher, the gas burner may be derated 4% for every 1000 feet of altitude. However, if the design ambient is cold enough then the effect of colder temperatures and higher altitudes may be offset.

#### **Example:**

A 1000 MBh furnace at an altitude of 3000 feet and 70°F ambient is derated (0.04 × 3 = 0.12). At 1000 MBh input (1000 × 0.12 MBh), the actual input is 1000 – 120 = 880 MBh at 3000 feet. If ambient is 10°F then no derate is required.

**NOTE:** Above 6000 feet, consult factory

34------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-34-0"></span># **System Operating Limits**

Daikin RoofPak systems are designed to operate over an extensive operating range. However, for proper system operation some limits do apply.

To help prevent moisture blow-off, design guidelines have been established for cooling coil selection.

Based on laboratory testing, average coil face velocities should not exceed the following limits:

- 650 ft/min for 8 and 10 fpi selections
- 600 ft/min for 12 fpi selections
- For applications outside of these limits, consult your Daikin Applied sales representative. Velocities exceeding these limits not only present the potential for moisture carry-over, but also high face velocities generate high air pressure drops, resulting in poor fan energy performance.

In addition to maximum face velocity limitations, minimum velocity guidelines are 200 ft/min When selecting a variable air volume unit, it is necessary to design the system such that the 200 ft/min limit is maintained at light load conditions.

# **Coil Freeze Protection**

When applying roof-mounted equipment in areas that experience subfreezing conditions, coil freeze protection measures must be provided. Subfreezing temperatures can adversely affect water and steam coils during controlled or uncontrolled unit shutdowns and even during unit operation. Daikin RoofPak economizer dampers are arranged to direct the outside and return air streams in multiple mixing patterns, minimizing air stratification. Even though this is one of the most effective mixing arrangements available, there may not always be a uniform unit temperature profile under all load and ambient temperatures. Some temperature stratification will occur, particularly at low ambient temperatures and the associated reduced airflow inherent with VAV systems. When required, static air mixers/blenders are available that can significantly improve mixing and reduce stratification. This can result in improved protection against freeze-up.

Glycol is strongly recommended as a positive means of freeze protection for water coils. No control sequence can prevent coil freezing in the event of a power failure or equipment malfunction. During those periods, glycol is the only positive means of freeze protection. When selecting water coils, specify glycol to account for performance differences.

*Figure 37: RAH 0 77C 40*" *DWDI airfoil* 

35------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-35-0"></span>An optional non-averaging freezestat equipment protection control can be provided, located downstream of the heating coil. If a potential freezing condition is sensed, a sequence is initiated by the unit control system, closing outdoor air dampers, opening the heating valve and de-energizing the fan. The freezestat setting should be some increment higher than freezing to provide an added margin of protection. The use of a freezestat control may cause nuisance trips. It cannot prevent freeze-up in the event of power failure or equipment malfunction.

Freeze protection control strategies must be designed to keep unit cabinet temperatures from exceeding 150°F during a unit shutdown. Temperatures in excess of 150°F may exceed the design limits of motors, electrical components, gaskets, etc. potentially leading to premature failure of components.

# **Piping and Condensate Drainage**

Always follow good industry practice in the design of the water piping system. Do not apply undue stress at the connection to coil headers. In addition, support piping independently from the coils with adequate piping flexibility for thermal expansion.

Provide all drain pans with a properly sized p-trap to allow free drainage of coil condensate. Provide traps to prevent cabinet static pressure from leaking air at the drain line in blowthrough coil applications. For draw-through coil applications, a properly sized and installed trap is essential to allow for proper condensate drainage. An improper trap could cause condensate to build up in the drain pan and overflow into the unit. For trap sizing, follow instruction given in IM 240 and IM 487. Run all traps and drain lines full size from the threaded unit connection to the roof drain

Units providing steam heat must be installed level to provide proper drainage and adequate steam pressure at the steam valve and coil. Condensate must be properly trapped with vacuum breakers installed on the coil (See [Figure 38](#page-35-1)). For steam piping recommendations, see Daikin Steam Coil Catalog 413.

# **Zone Sensor Placement**

Placement of the zone temperature sensor is critical for proper and economical operation of the heating and cooling system. It is generally recommended that the space sensor be located on an inside wall (3 to 5 feet from an outside wall) in a space having a floor area of at least 400 square feet. Do not locate the sensor below the outlet of a supply diffuser, in the direct rays of the sun, on a wall adjacent to an unheated or abnormally warm room (boiler or incinerator room), or near any heat producing equipment. Where zone sensor placement is a problem, all zone control systems, as standard, have the capability to use a return air sensor for heating and cooling.

# **Unit Wiring**

All units require three phase, 60 Hz, 208, 230, 460 or 575 volt power or three phase, 50 Hz, 400 volt power. Units do not operate satisfactorily at ±10% of rated voltage, at the power connections to the units. All units include branch circuit, short circuit protection and are available with one or multiple power blocks or non-fused disconnect switches. Each unit is provided with a 115-volt convenience outlet circuit. Per the NEC, this circuit must be fed independent of the main unit power supply.

All wiring must be installed in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) and local codes.

# **Winter Shipment**

Flat bed shipment in winter can expose units to harsh road chemicals. Since equipment size and configuration precludes covering during transit, wash units free of these chemicals as soon as possible to help prevent corrosion.

<span id="page-36-0"></span># **Field-Installed Actuators**

Install an actuator to meet the design torque requirement. For vane actuators, this requirement is based on the effective wheel diameter and design rpm of the fan. Use the following equation and table to size actuators:

*Torque (ft-lb) = (D) × (design rpm / 1000)²*

#### *Table 6: Effective wheel diameters*


Size damper actuators in relation to the damper area. For RDS 708B, 800C and 802C units, a 50 in-lb electric actuator is recommended for proper operation. Typically, a 160° stroke rotary electric actuator can handle up to 40 sq ft of damper. For pneumatic actuators, allow 5 in-lb per square foot of damper area.

Areas of unit openings and dampers are tabulated in the following table. To minimize pressure drop and help prevent moisture intake, keep air velocity through the 100% outside air hood to a maximum of 1000 feet per minute. Air velocity through the 0–30% outside air hood or through the 0–100% economizer intake louvers/ hoods should not exceed 740 feet per minute.

Discharge or return opening, VAV or isolation dampers have the same face area as the opening (see dimensional drawings).

Face and bypass damper face areas are shown in the [Physical](#page-42-1)  [Data on page 43.](#page-42-1)

#### *Table 7: Outside/return air damper and opening areas*


\* The RDS 800 with 15" ft FC return fan has an 19 sq ft outside air louver opening.

# **Face and Bypass Damper Option**

Face and bypass dampers are offered for coil capacity control when control valves are not suitable. This option is especially beneficial for heating applications requiring a large percent of outside air. Face and bypass dampers also can provide some amount of coil freeze protection. However, additional freeze protection should be provided. Design air velocity through bypass dampers should not exceed 2500 feet per minute. Reference the [Physical Data](#page-42-1) section for face and bypass areas when determining airflow rates.

37------------------------------------------------



**Unit Selection**

<span id="page-37-0"></span>Achieving the optimal performance of a rooftop system requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that control the unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation and air filtration requirements, heating and cooling loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and installation limitations. Daikin RoofPak units offer a wide selection of component options providing the capability to meet diverse application requirements.

The Daikin SelectTools software selection program allows your local Daikin Applied sales representative to provide you with fast, accurate and complete selection of Daikin RoofPak units. You also can select your unit through reference to physical, performance, dimensional, and unit weight data included in this catalog. Due to the variety of cooling coil options available, only a sample of cooling capacity data is presented in the catalog.

To properly select unit equipment:

- 1. Select unit size and cooling coil
- 2. Select heating coils and equipment
- 3. Select fans and motors

Below are examples that illustrate the equations and catalog references used in the unit selection process.

### *Example 1*

A constant volume system with chilled water, gas heat, economizer with return fan, and 65% efficient filtration is required to meet the following criteria:

$$\begin{array}{c} \mathsf{Supply air capacity} = 26,000 \text{ cfm} \\ \mathsf{Return air capacity} = 20,800 \text{ cfm} \\ \text{Maximum face velocity} = 600 \text{ fpm} \\ \mathsf{Supply duct} = 2.00 \text{-} \text{in wg} \\ \mathsf{Return duct} = 0.50 \text{-} \text{in wg} \\ \end{array}$$

### **Summer design:**

Ambient air temperature = 95°F Mixed air temperature = 80°F/67°F Entering water temperature = 45°F Leaving water temperature = 55°F

- Total cooling load = 640,000 Btu/hr
	- Sensible cooling load = 510,000 Btu/hr

### **Winter design:**

Entering air temperature = 60°F Total heating load = 700,000 Btu/hr Air temperature rise = 20°F **Electrical design:** 460 V/60 Hz/3 phase

# **Selecting Unit Size and Arrangement**

Unit size is based on coil face area and cooling capacity requirements. Supply air capacity and maximum face velocity constraints should serve as a guide for selecting coil dimensions and cabinet size. Many model sizes are available with a standard and a high airflow coil selection. This flexibility prevents the need to increase cabinet size to accommodate high airflow per ton applications. Face and bypass dampers (if required) should be requested from the start to provide proper unit sizing.

Based on the given data, the appropriate coil face area may be determined as follows:

Minimum face area = supply air cfm/max. face velocity = 26,000 cfm/600 fpm = 43.3 square feet

**NOTE:** Unit data is based on standard air conditions of 70°F at sea level. Refer to [Table 5 on page 34](#page-33-2) for temperature/ altitude conversion factors for nonstandard conditions.

Face and bypass is not specified for this example. Therefore, referring to [Physical Data on page 43,](#page-42-1) the correct unit size is 047 CL. This unit has a total coil face area of 45 square feet, which is greater than the minimum required.

Determine system arrangement initially to clarify component selection. [Indoor Fan and Motor Heat, Blow-through vs.](#page-32-3)  [Draw-through Cooling on page 33](#page-32-3) discusses draw-through/ blow-through decision criteria. For the given example, a blow-through arrangement should be provided to offer greater sensible heat capacity.

# **Selecting Cooling Coils**

Use the Daikin SelecTools for Contractor Coils selection program to select unit coils. See [Physical Data on page 43](#page-42-1) to specify coils. See [Cooling Capacity Data on page 48](#page-47-1) for valve and piping pressure drops for chilled water coils. In addition, see [Application Considerations on page 29](#page-28-1) for information on face velocity guidelines, fan motor heat gain, and other unit coil considerations. For the given blow-through coil, add fan and motor heat gain to the entering air conditions.

38------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-38-0"></span>**Selecting Heating Coils and Equipment**

Electric heat and furnaces can be completely selected from the [Heating Capacity Data on page 51.](#page-50-1) To select hot water and steam heating coil selections:

- 1. To identify coil fin height, fin length, available fins per inch, and available row, see [Physical Data on page 43](#page-42-1) [— 56.](#page-55-0)
- 2. Use the Coil SelectTools selection program to select the coil with acceptable capacity and pressure drops.
- 3. Add optional hot water valve and piping pressure drop, provided in the [Heating Capacity Data on page 51](#page-50-1), to the hot water coil pressure drop obtained from the Coil SelectTools program.

# **Gas Heat**

When selecting a gas furnace, the system heating load, minimum airflow and maximum temperature rise constraints are needed. See [Figure 43 on page 51](#page-50-2) for furnace model size selection. Enter the graph at 206,000 cfm and move up vertically to the intersection of 700 MBh output. In this example, the intersection of Minimum cfm and MBh Output occurs between model lines. Therefore, the larger model size, Model 790, should be selected for adequate heating. For all heat exchangers, there exists a maximum temperature rise. This limitation is determined by the heat exchanger surface area to airflow ratio. See [Table 21 on page 52](#page-51-0) for verification of the temperature rise capability of the furnace selected. Also, use this table when specifying baffle position based on minimum airflow design. Refer to [Altitude Adjustments on page](#page-33-3)  [34](#page-33-3).

**NOTE:** In VAV applications, consider range of airflow modulation when selecting furnace model and baffle position. The maximum temperature rise cannot be exceeded at either maximum or minimum airflows.

# **Hot Water Heat**

### **Hot water design:**

Entering water temperature = 180°F Leaving water temperature = 165°F

The water temperature drop (Δt) is as follows:

$$\Delta t = \texttt{Ent. \texttt{wæter temp.} - \texttt{Lvg. \texttt{wæter temp.}}}$$

The Coil SelectTools program indicates that the Standard Capacity hot water coil provides 748 MBh at design conditions and provides sufficient capacity. Water pressure drop is 6.0 feet of water column.

At a water temperature drop of 15°F, the water flow rate required is 102 gpm. Enter the value at 102 gpm and select a valve size that has a pressure drop greater than 11.5 feet of water. The valve pressure drop should be as large as possible to maintain proper valve modulation. The valve pressure drop should be at least 50% of the total water pressure drop. If more than one valve selection meets the requirement, make the valve size decision based on first cost versus pumping head.

The total water pressure drop of the unit water coil is the sum of the coil, valve, and valve piping. Valve and valve piping pressure drops are illustrated in [Figure 39](#page-47-2) and [Figure 40 on](#page-47-3)  [page 48.](#page-47-3) For the given example, the total water pressure drop is as follows:

### **Unit water coil pressure drops:**

Standard capacity coil, 045C to 75C = 6.0 ft of water 1-1/2-in valve = 22.0 ft of water 1-1/2-in valve piping = 11.5 ft of water Total water pressure drop = 39.5 ft wc of water

The pressure drop of the 1-1/2-in valve is 56% of the total pressure drop and is acceptable.

If a glycol solution is used in the water coil, use the Daikin SelectTools selection program for accurate coil and valve sizing or contact your Daikin Applied sales representative.

# **Steam Heat**

**Steam design:**

```
Steam supply pressure = 10 psig
```
With an 80% pressure drop across the valve, determine the steam coil pressure as follows:

*Steam coil pressure = 10 – (10 × 0.80) = 2 psig*

The Coil SelectTools program indicates that the Standard Capacity steam coil provides 823 MBh at design conditions and provides sufficient capacity. This heating capacity meets design; therefore, the standard face area steam coil for the unit is acceptable.

Valve size can be determined from the condensation rate of steam for a given coil pressure. Use Table 9 and Table 10 below to select manual steam valve selection for systems with atmospheric return mains and supply main pressure not exceeding 25 psig at stated conditions. For the given example, find the appropriate valve size as follows:

> Condensation Rate = Capacity/latent heat of steam = 823,000 / 966.1 = 852 lb/hr

<span id="page-39-0"></span>Enter [Table 8,](#page-39-1) at 10 psig and 852 lb/hr. The correct valve size is 1-1/2 in For other operating conditions, use the Selection program for accurate selection or contact your Daikin Applied sales representative.

Steam traps are field furnished and mounted. Refer to [Application Considerations on page 29](#page-28-1) of this catalog or Daikin Steam Coil Catalog 413 for piping recommendations.

#### <span id="page-39-2"></span>*Table 9: Saturated steam properties*


# **Selecting Fans and Motors**

Fan and motor selections are based on total static pressure drop and design airflow. Total static pressure includes internal air pressure drops of unit components and external air pressure drops in supply and return ducts.

In the [Component Pressure Drops on page 57](#page-56-1) section, see [Table 29 on page 57](#page-56-2) and [Table 32 on page 59](#page-58-0) for internal pressure drops of unit components. When selecting unit fans and motors, use the fan curves provided in [Fan Performance](#page-61-1)  [on page 62](#page-61-1), [SWSI Supply Fans on page 71](#page-70-1), [Propeller](#page-72-1)  [Exhaust Fans on page 73,](#page-72-1) and [Return Fans on page 75](#page-74-1). To optimize fan performance, select the fan size having design airflow and static pressure intersecting as close to the first system curve as possible after the shaded Do Not Select region. See [Application Considerations on page 29](#page-28-1).

Select the motor size as close below the horsepower curve as possible to prevent motor oversizing. An oversized motor (large horsepower to load ratio) can greatly increase electric consumption due to the reduction in motor performance.

# **Return Fan and Motor**

Select an economizer with a return fan for the given system. A return (or exhaust fan) system is often necessary for maintaining proper pressure in a building. See [Application](#page-28-1)  [Considerations on page 29](#page-28-1) for more information on the economizer and return fan application. Use the external air pressure drop of the return duct along with the design return airflow to select a return fan. Based on [Figure 79 on page](#page-77-0)  [78](#page-77-0), the return fan size is 44 inches and the bhp = 4.6. The required fan motor size is 5.0 hp.

# **Supply Fan and Motor**

Since this system includes a return fan, the return duct static pressure drop is not added to the supply fan pressure drop. Therefore, total static pressure for the supply fan in the example is:

### **Internal pressure drops:**


### **External pressure drops:**

Supply duct = 2.00-in wg Total external pressure drop = 2.00-in wg

Total static pressure = internal drops + external drops

$$\begin{array}{rcl} = & 2.02 + 2.00 \\ = & 4.02 \text{ in } \bowtie \text{gg} \end{array}$$

**NOTE:** When gas or electric heat is provided, do not add the cooling coil diffuser pressure drop. In VAV applications with gas heat, consult your Daikin Applied sales representative for design pressure drop determinations.

40------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-40-0"></span>For the constant volume, blow-through unit in Example 1, a DWDI, forward curve or airfoil type fan can be selected. See [Application Considerations on page 29](#page-28-1) for fan configuration considerations. A fan type selection comparison for Example 1 is conducted as follows:

The optimal fan size for an airfoil fan without vanes is 30" (from [Figure 59 on page 68](#page-67-0)). Corresponding fan motor characteristics are: Fan rpm = 1450 Brake horsepower = 27

Make the final selection by comparing energy savings to first cost as follows:

*Payback = savings / cost*

### where:

*Savings = (bhp2 – bhp1) × (0.75 kW/hp / motor eff.) × \$/kwh × hr/yr, and cost = (fan and motor cost)1 – (fan and motor cost)2*

# **Supply Power Wiring for Units Without Electric Heat**

Sizing supply power wire for a unit is based on the circuit with the largest amperage draw. With the power package option, all electrical equipment is wired to a central panel for single or optional dual connections. For Example 1, inclusion of a power package with a single power connection is assumed. Refer to [Electrical Data on page 99](#page-98-1) for FLA and RLA ratings of equipment. Determining wire sizing amperes for Example 1 is as follows.

### **Fans Only:**

Wire sizing amperes = 1.25 × FLA of largest motor +1.00 × FLA of other loads

> Supply fan motor, 30 hp . 37.5 Return fan motor, 5 hp . 7.0

Therefore, wire sizing amperes = 1.25 × 37.5 + 1.00 × 7.0 = 53.9 amperes

### *Example 2*

A constant air volume system with electric heat at 50 Hz. Applicable design constraints in Example 1 are used in Example 2 with the following parameters.

### **Winter design:**


# **Selecting Unit Size and Arrangement**

For units providing no cooling, base model size on design supply air capacity. Refer to the [Physical Data on page 43](#page-42-1) for approximate operating airflow ranges of each unit. The minimum volume of air may be lower than the specified range. Check the unit fan curve for stable operation of fan at desired operating conditions. Based on air capacity constraints in Example 2, select a RAH 047CY unit.

# **Selecting Heating Equipment at 50Hz**

### **Electric heat**

Select electric heat based on design heating load, minimum supply air capacity, and air temperature rise requirements. A maximum air temperature rise and minimum airflow limit exist with all electric heaters. For the electric heating elements available, the minimum airflow requirements are as follows:

```
RAH 047C . 14,200 cfm minimum
RAH 077C . 21,000 cfm minimum
```
Also, the supply fan static pressure is limited to 5.0 inches wg in electric heat applications. Limitations are based on testing performed under ETL-Canada guidelines.

When selecting electric heat for Example 2, correct heater capacity to account for derated voltage supply. First convert the given heating load to kW as follows:

kW = MBh / 3.413 = 480 / 3.413 = 140.6 kW

Since electrical data is not tabulated for a 380/50/3 supply, use data provided for a voltage rating greater than design. For Example 2, 480/60/3 data is used to determine the appropriate model size of the heater. Follow the steps below when derating electric heat:

- 1. Choose model size from tabulated kW greater than design.
- 2. Derate tabulated kW.
- 3. If derated kW is greater than design, select electric heater.

41------------------------------------------------

| 0        |      1 |      2 |      3 |
|:---------|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Volts    | 380    | 400    | 415    |
| O.D.P.   |   0.85 |   0.8  |   0.75 |
| T.E.F.C. |   0.8  |   0.75 |   0.7  |



<span id="page-41-0"></span>#### **Example 2—Model 240**

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathsf{kW2} & = & \mathsf{kW1} \times \mathsf{V2} \,/\,\mathsf{V1} \,\mathsf{i} 2 \\ & = & \mathsf{238.8} \times \mathsf{(380 / 480)2} \\ & = & \mathsf{149.7 } \mathsf{kW} \end{array}$$

Based on heating load capacity, Model 240 is adequate. Reference [Table 27](#page-54-0) and [Table 28 on page 55](#page-54-1) for air temperature rise data for heater. The air temperature rise capability of this model at design conditions is 26.4°F. Comparing this value with design for a 20°F temperature rise confirms the acceptability of Model 240.

When electrical data is not tabulated, calculate the FLA rating of the heater as follows:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathsf{FLA} &=& (\mathsf{kW} \times \mathsf{l000}) / (\mathsf{1.732} \times \mathsf{V}) \\ &=& (\mathsf{149.7} \times \mathsf{1000}) / (\mathsf{1.732} \times \mathsf{380}) \\ &=& \textbf{227.5} \text{ amps} \end{array}$$

# **Selecting Motors at 50 Hz**

When operating at 50 Hz, available fan motors operate at approximately 5/6 the rated capacity. Fans and motors may be selected as in Example 1. However, selected motors must be derated and design verified. The table below provides motor correction factors for derating horsepower at 50 Hz.

#### *Table 10: Motor correction factors*


## **Supply power wiring for fans and electric heat**

For Example 2, supply power wiring can be sized based on the following wire sizing amperes formula.

### **Electric heat plus fans:**

• Electric heat less than or equal to 50 kW:

MCA = 1.25 (largest motor load plus heater FLA) + (the rest of the loads)

• Electric heat greater than or equal to 50 kW:

MCA = 1.25 (largest motor load) + heater FLA + (the rest of the loads)

### *Example 3*

# **Selecting RAH O77CL Chilled Water Coils**

Supply airflow = 40,000 cfm

The RAH O77CL unit contains two staggered chilled water coils with a fin height of 63 inches each (see the [Physical Data](#page-42-1)  [on page 43](#page-42-1)). Divide coils greater than 54" in height and individually run them on the coil selection program. For the given configuration, split the coil into one 30 × 83 coil and one 33 × 83 coil and specify accordingly.

Ratio the airflow to each coil as follows:

Ind. airflow = airflow × (in FH / total FH) = 40,000 × (30/126) = 9,523 cfm = 40,000 × (33/126) = 10,476 cfm

Read the coil selection output as follows:

- 1. Add capacities together and multiply by two for staggered configuration.
- 2. Take air pressure drop directly from individual run.
- 3. Add water flow rates together.
- 4. Use the lowest water pressure drop value without addition. The most economical chilled water unit coil is a 5WL with 4 rows and 12 fpi. This coil assembly has a cooling capacity of 1126 MBh sensible and 1615 MBh total. Air pressure drop is 0.92 inches of water across the coil. The required water flow rate is 160 gpm with a water pressure drop of 12.5 feet of water through the coil.

For the RAH O77CL without F&BP and the RAH O77CS with F&BP, [Table 16 on page 49](#page-48-1) provides additional header pressure drops. These values are added to the water pressure drop provided by the coil selection program to account for the presence of a continuous header. In the given example, an additional 6.5 feet of water is added resulting in a water pressure drop of 19 feet of water through the coil.

### **Example:**

RAH O77CL chilled water valve and piping selection

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{Coill type} & = \text{5 } \mathsf{ML} \\ \text{Water flow rate} & = \text{160 gpm} \end{array}$$

Determine valve size selection for the given chilled water coil by entering [Figure 41 on page 49](#page-48-2) at 160 gpm and moving vertically up past the minimum pressure drop line to the nearest curve. Select a 2" valve with a pressure drop of 19.5 feet of water under design conditions. For proper temperature control, maintain adequate pressure drop through the valve.

To determine the pressure drop through the valve piping, first reference [Table 15 on page 47](#page-46-0) for the assigned index number of the given valve. Then enter [Figure 41 on page 49](#page-48-2) at the designated index number and water flow rate. Following vertically down from the gpm curve, locate the corresponding pressure drop. For this example, the chilled water valve piping pressure drop is 8.0 feet of water. Therefore, the total valve and piping pressure drop for the given chilled water coil is 27.5 feet of water.

## **RAH 047C and 077C**

#### <span id="page-58-0"></span>*Table 32: Component air pressure drops (in wg)—RAH 047C*


**Notes:**

1. Pressure drop through hood and damper is based on 30% of listed airflow.

2. Pressure drop through the economizer assumes that all of the air will be passing through the return air dampers.

3. If a discharge plenum is not used with a DWDI supply fan, subtract this static pressure factor from the total static pressure drop.

4. Pressure drop through cooling coils can be found in the Daikin MS-85 selection program output or Coil Catalog 411.

5. A cooling diffuser is provided on blow-through units with cooling, hot water or steam heating.

6. Base design pressure drop across face and bypass dampers on the position creating the greatest resistance.

#### *Table 33: Component air pressure drops (in wg)—RAH 077C*


**Notes:**

1. Pressure drop through hood and damper is based on 30% of listed airflow.

2. Pressure drop through the economizer assumes that all of the air will be passing through the return air dampers.

3. If a discharge plenum is not used with a DWDI supply fan, subtract this static pressure factor from the total static pressure drop.

4. Pressure drop through cooling coils can be found in the Daikin MS-85 selection program output or Coil Catalog 411.

5. A cooling diffuser is provided on blow-through units with cooling, hot water or steam heating.

6. Base design pressure drop across face and bypass dampers on the position creating the greatest resistance.

# **Service Clearance**

Allow recommended service clearances shown in [Figure 117](#page-95-2), [Figure 118,](#page-95-3) [Figure 119](#page-95-4), and [Figure 120.](#page-95-5) Provide a roof walkway along two sides of the unit for service and access to most controls. Contact your Daikin sales representative for service requirements less than those recommended.

96------------------------------------------------



# **Overhead Clearance**

- Unit(s) surrounded by screens or solid walls must have no overhead obstructions over any part of the unit.
- Area above condenser must be unobstructed in all installations to allow vertical air discharge.
- The following restrictions must be observed for overhead obstructions above the air handler section:
	- There must be no overhead obstructions above the furnace flue, or within 9 inches of the flue box.
	- Any overhead obstruction must not be within 2 inches of the top of the unit.
	- A service canopy must not protrude more than 24 inches beyond the unit in the area of the outside air and exhaust dampers.

### *Figure 121: Overhead clearances*

# **Ventilation Clearance**

### *Unit(s) surrounded by a screen or a fence:*

- The bottom of the screen should be a minimum of 1 ft above the roof surface.
- Minimum distance, unit to screen: same service clearance.
- Minimum distance, unit to unit: 120 in

### *Unit(s) surrounded by solid walls:*

- Minimum distance, unit to wall: 96 in, all sizes
- Minimum distance, unit to unit: 120 in
- Wall height restrictions:
	- Wall on one side only or on two adjacent sides: no restrictions.
	- Walls on more than two adjacent sides: wall height not to exceed unit height.

Do not locate outside air intakes near exhaust vents or other sources of contaminated air.

If the unit is installed where windy conditions are common, install wind screens around the unit, maintaining the clearances specified above. This is particularly important to prevent blowing snow from entering outside air intakes, and to maintain adequate head pressure control when mechanical cooling is required at low outdoor air temperatures. SpeedTrol, which is required for compressor operation below 45° F, will maintain proper head pressure in calm wind conditions.

# **Supply Power Wiring**

### *Table 40: Recommended power wiring*


- 1. Units require three-phase power supply.
- 2. Allowable voltage tolerances:
	- a. 60 Hertz
		- Nameplate 208 V: Min 187 V, Max. 229 V
		- Nameplate 230 V: Min 207 V, Max. 253 V
		- Nameplate 460 V: Min 414 V, Max. 506 V
		- Nameplate 575 V: Min 518 V, Max. 633 V
	- b. 50 Hertz
	- Nameplate 380V: Min 360V, Max. 418V
- 3. Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) Calculation:
- **NOTE:** If a unit is provided with multiple power connections, each must be considered alone in selecting power wiring components.
	- 4. The MCA is calculated based on the following formula:
		- a. Fan(s) only:

MCA = 1.25 × largest load + sum of all other loads

b. Electric heat plus fan(s):

Heater is = 50 kW

MCA = 1.25 × (heater FLA + largest motor load) + (the rest of the loads)

Heater is > 50 kW

MCA = 1.25 × (largest motor load) + (the rest of the loads) + heater FLA

- **NOTE:** Control circuit ampacity does not need to be considered in the calculation for wire sizing ampacity. If the unit is provided with one or more fan section lights, they are powered from the separate 15 amp (minimum), 120V supply required by the NEC for the unit convenience outlet.
	- 5. Size wires in accordance with Table 310-16 or 310-19 of the National Electrical Code.
	- 6. Size the wires for a maximum of 3% voltage drop.

# <span id="page-103-0"></span>**Roof Curb Weights—RDS 800C and 802C**

Calculate the weight of the unit curb using one of the following equations and adding additional weights accordingly.

# **Weight Formula**

*Base curb wt. (lb) = 0.74 [170 + 2 × curb length (in)]*

### **Additional Weights:**

- 1. For return plenum with bottom opening, add 91 lb
- 2. For discharge plenum with bottom opening, add 78 lb
- 3. For blank compartment out of airstream, add 30 lb
- 4. Cross supports:
	- a. For curb length greater than 144 in, add 30 lb
	- b. For curb length greater than 288 in, add 60 lb
	- c. For curb length greater than 432 in, add 90 lb
	- d. For curb length greater than 576 in, add 120 lb

# **Fin Correction Factors**

#### **5/8" Coils**

- 6 fpi. . Deduct 0.28 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 8 fpi. . None
- 10 fpi. . Add 0.28 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 12 fpi. . Add 0.56 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 14 fpi. . Add 0.84 lb/sq ft of face area/row

#### **1" Coils**

- 6 fpi. . Deduct 0.62 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 8 fpi. . None
- 10 fpi. . Add 0.62 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 12 fpi. . Add 1.24 lb/sq ft of face area/row
- 14 fpi. . Add 1.86 lb/sq ft of face area/row

### *Table 42: RDS 708B coil weights (lbs)*


**Note:** Coil weight based on 8 fpi.

#### *Table 43: RDS 800C and 802C coil weights (lbs)*


**Note:** 1. Coil weight based on 8 fpi.

2. Correcting for actual weight of 75", 78" or 82" unit code is not significant
