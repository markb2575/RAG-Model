## Environmentally Friendly

Rebel's heat pump technology uses electricity to move heat, rather than generating it through gas-powered heating. This results in lower carbon emissions and a more environmentally sustainable heating and cooling solution for various climate regions and seasons. So much so, that many government financial incentives are available to encourage adoption of the technology.

The Rebel heat pump system utilizes advanced variable speed compressors and electronic commutated motor fans to enable precise temperature control while minimizing energy waste to ensure optimal performance, sustainable operation, and lessen impact on your building's financial budget.

OVERVIEW

## Low GWP Refrigerant

With a GWP of 675, R-32 contributes less to global warming potential compared to other refrigerants like R-410A. Because of R-32's excellent thermodynamic performance characteristics, an R-32 system could have up to 40% less charge than R-410A in certain applications, meaning you could reduce refrigerant usage in the equipment and potentially also reduce quantities leaking to the environment.

Being a pure, single-component refrigerant, R-32 can't lose its composition like a blended refrigerant and is well suited to retain its quality over time. It can be topped off and recharged in the field in both liquid and gas phases; because the composition doesn't change, it's easy to clean and reuse on site. R-32 can be reclaimed and recycled with a simple cleaning process, as compared to blends with less stable HFOs that must be distilled to their pure compounds and then remixed.

Compared to R-410A and R-454B, R-32 has several advantages when it comes to Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP). Its lower leakage and service charge result in reduced emissions during use, contributing to a lower overall LCCP. Additionally, R-32's ease of reclamation comparatively showcases lower potential for overall emissions at the end of its lifecycle.

### Industry-Leading Performance

If you are a commercial building owner, facility manager, or specifying engineer with demanding rooftop performance criteria, you need the best performance. With a Daikin Rebel rooftop system you'll experience outstanding energy efficiency, unwavering performance, low-audible sound, superior comfort control and dehumidification, while benefitting your bottom line from substantial cost-savings.

Producing an astounding 22.7 IEER and 55% energy savings above ASHRAE's 90.1 standard, Rebel generates efficiencies previously unachievable in a commercial rooftop system. Rebel's exceptional performance makes it ideal for any lowrise commercial building like schools, offices, grocery, or retail stores, as well as 100% outdoor air, VAV with duct pressure control, single-zone VAV, and VRV applications.

That’s why we set out to develop a new generation of heat pump technology that delivers high levels of performance in the coldest of conditions. As outdoor temperatures decrease, a typical building’s heating demand increases. Simultaneously, as the outdoor temperature decreases, the heat pump’s output capacity decreases forcing the remaining heat load to be supplemented by a gas or electric heat source. Unlike traditional heat pumps that have limited heating capacity at low ambient temperatures, Daikin’s inverter compressor technology overcomes this challenge by boosting the compressors heating output on the coldest days. This allows our heat pumps to satisfy building demand during colder conditions in turn reducing the capacity and run time of supplemental heat, providing a more efficient solution that lowers the electrical load and produces fewer carbon emissions when compared to electric resistance heating. Typically, replacing gas equipment with electric alternatives can double a building’s electrical needs, leading to higher installation costs. Rebel tackles this challenge by leveraging existing wiring and isolating new loads on smaller circuits, reducing installation costs. Additionally, Rebel offers configurable auxiliary electric heat limits and emergency backup controls, further minimizing peak electrical load. |     |     |

Typically, replacing gas equipment with electric alternatives can double a building's electrical needs, leading to higher installation costs. Rebel tackles this challenge by leveraging existing wiring and isolating new loads on smaller circuits, reducing installation costs. Additionally, Rebel offers configurable auxiliary electric heat limits and emergency backup controls, further minimizing peak electrical load.

## ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

## Energy Recovery

By incorporating an energy recovery wheel or fixed plate heat exchanger energy recovery system, Rebel can help improve overall energy efficiency by recovering and reusing energy that would otherwise be wasted. This can result in significant energy savings, particularly for facilities with high heating or cooling demands.

Energy Savings: Improves overall energy efficiency by recovering and reusing energy that would otherwise be wasted

Equipment Savings: Allows for a 30% downsize of the cooling system

Eco Friendly: Lower energy consumption translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions

Comfort: Maintains a consistent indoor temperature and air quality while helping regulate humidity levels to ensure fresh air is supplied to the building

## EC Fan Motors

Compared to traditional AC fan motors, EC motors deliver significantly higher efficiency and substantial energy cost savings. This is attributed to two key innovations: permanent magnets which eliminate energy losses associated with generating magnetism, and advanced electronic controls that enable direct energy conversion and variable speed operation. These technologies work together to create a solution that minimizes energy waste and reduces the cooling load.

Additionally, ECM fans require minimal maintenance. Their technologically advanced design eliminates the need for mechanical maintenance on belts and bearings, contributing to reliable performance throughout their extended lifecycle.

Standby for critical applications and processes is another efficient use for temporary rental equipment. A temporary system is sometimes used to back up manufacturing and chemical processes, or when a hospital's required system redundancy has been reduced.

### SUPPLEMENTAL CAPACITY

When the demand of your facility or process exceeds your current system's capacity because of record-high temperatures or changes to cooling requirements, Daikin temporary rentals can be used to increase your heating or cooling output. By eliminating the need to purchase additional equipment that might be only used part of the year, you save on capital expenditures.
