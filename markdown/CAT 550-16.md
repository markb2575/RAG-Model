# **Introduction**

### **Quality**

Daikin Applied air handling equipment has been respected and regarded as high quality for nearly 60 years. Daikin Applied has taken a major step in redefining the indoor air handler with the Vision air handler. Demands for improved indoor air quality, low sound, high operating efficiency and smaller mechanical rooms require a better product for today's air handler market. The Daikin Applied Vision air handler is designed to meet or exceed these demands.

The key to providing such a high quality product is in the basic design. The Daikin Applied Vision air handler's patented construction provides unequaled thermal efficiencies and low leak rates. In addition, Vision air handlers offer tremendous flexibility in sizing, component options, and unit arrangements to meet the indoor air quality, operating efficiency, sound and installation requirements for today's extensive commercial and custom markets.

### **Flexibility**

By virtue of its unique frame design, the Daikin Applied Vision air handler offers tremendous flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in our unique Variable Dimensioning™ feature that allows units to be sized in two-inch increments (height and width) to fit the available space. Numerous section and component options, and the ability to arrange components in whatever arrangement is required, allow Vision air handlers to be customized to the requirements of each job, without expensive field modifications. Finally, Vision air handlers can be shipped as a completely assembled unit, in modules or by component sections for new or retrofit applications that require smaller sections for passage through the building.

### **Cabinet Construction**

Daikin Applied Vision air handler cabinetry consists of a boxtype frame channel—the backbone of the unit—and easy-toremove panels or hinged access doors. The unique, patented frame channel design allows three identical pieces to be bolted together to form a corner of the unit. Channel material is G90 unpainted galvanized steel (optional—painted G60 galvanized steel) with neoprene gasketing on all flanges to minimize leakage. Gasketing is also factory applied at all contact surfaces between interior and exterior metal components to minimize thermal bridging. See Figure 2.

Panels are secured to the unit with fasteners that can be easily removed to access the unit interior. The frame channel and panels are easily disassembled and reassembled, giving contractors tremendous flexibility in installing and servicing the units—even where space is limited—saving time and money. Patented splice joints (Figure 3) help guide sections together for a tight fit, saving additional time and money on installation.

### **Standard Cabinet**

This unique cabinet design results in air tight, thermally efficient units, which translates into energy savings over the life of the unit. Vision air handlers are capable of casing leakage rates that shall not exceed 0.50 CFM per square foot of casing surface area a design static pressure up to a maximum of +5" w.c. in positive pressure sections and -6" w.c. in negative pressure sections.

### **High Pressure Cabinet**

The high pressure air handler construction utilizes laser welding technology to provide stronger frame channels and new gaskets to reduce the standard leakage rate to a casing leakage rate that shall not exceed ASHRAE 111 Class 6 or be no more than 1% of the supply air volume at design static pressure up to a maximum of +8" w.c. (whichever is greater) in positive pressure sections and -8" w.c. in negative pressure sections, where casing leakage (CFM/100 ft2 of casing surface area) = CL × P0.65. The high pressure air handler construction maintains the unique flexibility, ease of installation and serviceability that Vision has had for years while providing best-in-class air sealing.

ASHRAE 111 is the test standard to test duct leakage. The standard uses a class system to indicate relative leakage rates. These class levels are dependent on static pressure and surface area. The formula for leak class is:

$$c\_z - \frac{F}{P^{\alpha\alpha}}$$

where *F =* and *P = Static pressure in inches w.c. Leakage in CFM 100 ft2 Cabinet Surface Area*

Vision air handler panels use the latest technology to provide the lowest deflection, lightest weight and most importantly, the most thermally efficient 2-inch thick panel system available. R-13 insulation quality injected-foam is thermally pressed between inner and outer liners yielding an extremely rigid panel. The inner liner comes standard with galvanized steel or optional stainless steel. The outer liner standard is galvanized steel with options of pre-painted, or pre-painted heavy-gauge, galvanized steel.

Base rails are provided as an option on unit sizes through 21 square feet and are standard on larger units. They are available to meet jobsite height requirements, ranging from 4" to 12" and can eliminate the need for a housekeeping pad saving time and money on installation. A full perimeter base rail per shipping section is factory assembled.

### **Seismic Design Considerations**

Strict design, testing, and certification requirements for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment are clearly defined in the International Building Code, versions 2000 and 2003, for designated structures in earthquake-prone locations. The goals of these requirements are to maintain systems to protect the public from hazard and maintain essential public services immediately after an earthquake. With the widespread adoption of the IBC throughout the U.S., it is important to understand its requirements and their impact on your specific building, and where you can turn for equipment to satisfy those requirements. Tested and certified compliant with the seismic provisions of the IBC, Daikin Applied Vision and Skyline air handlers also comply with the construction requirements of NFPA 5000.

For use by the building official and design professional, the IBC has defined Seismic Use Group designations based on building use along with specific criteria for determining the Seismic Design Category of the building and the applicability of seismic design criteria to the building's mechanical equipment. Provide this information to your local Daikin Applied Sales Representative so the proper modifications can be made to the air handler and have a compliance label affixed to the product so all IBC requirements in this regard are complied with. For additional information, Daikin Applied has several published articles explaining in detail IBC seismic requirements. Go to www.DaikinApplied.com or contact your local Daikin Applied sales representative to obtain these articles.

Daikin Applied also has construction pre-certified for California's strict Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) requirements. The OSP pre-approval shows that Daikin Applied has already completed testing to allow engineers to specify, contractors to install, and owners to operate equipment that will still work after a seismic event.

### **Access and Serviceability**

Equipment must be designed to perform efficiently and withstand the wear and tear of everyday use. It must be designed to provide easy access to interior components for routine maintenance and service to maintain peak performance. The patented frame channels and easy-toremove panels or hinged access doors of the Vision air handler cabinet provide complete access to the unit interior and components. Components, including the fan and coil assembly, can be removed through the side of the unit, top of the unit, or a combination of both, which reduces required service clearances (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Coil removal on unstacked coils does not require access to the non-connection end of the coil. A unique coil tie down method simplifies coil removal and replacement.

### **Daikin Applied SelectTools Software Selection Program**

Because the Daikin Applied Vision air handler is so flexible and has so many different component types, there virtually are an infinite number of possible unit arrangements. To help the customer easily define their product requirements, Daikin Applied provides a user-friendly software selection program, called Daikin Applied SelectTools. This program configures and sizes both standard and custom units. Components can be selected in minutes. This Windows® based program leads the user through the selection process by prompting for pertinent input data for all components required. Component sections are selected by placing them on a configuration screen.

Once the unit layout is defined, the options and accessories are identified. The program gives immediate feedback regarding fan and coil selection, offering a choice of many different options based on the performance inputs. Once final component selections have been made, the program provides all output needed for specification and submittal purposes, including fan curves, coil performance psychometric charts, weights, dimensional drawings, and a unit specification. A fully detailed DXF file is also available. Daikin Applied SelectTools is a comprehensive, efficient, and user-friendly software selection program.

# **Component Types**

### **Fans**

Fan types available with the Daikin Applied Vision air handling units are housed double width, double inlet (DWDI) forward curved and airfoil fans, plenum fans, twin fans and fan array. Forward curved fans generally provide the lowest first cost option and are used for lower static pressure applications.

### **DWDI Housed Fans**

Daikin Applied housed forward curved fans will typically operate up to 6.0" of static pressure. Airfoil fans have a higher first cost, but are more efficient, quieter and can handle higher static pressures. Daikin Applied housed airfoil fans will operate up to 9.0" of static pressure.

### **Plenum Fans**

Plenum fans (Figure 6) save space by eliminating turns in ductwork. They also provide a high degree of flexibility when locating the outlet ductwork. Plenum fans are also very good for blow-through applications as they generate a uniform outlet velocity profile. Both belt-drive and direct-drive plenum fans are available.

Direct-drive plenum fans offer easier maintenance as they do not have fan bearings, sheaves, or belts.

### **Dual Fans**

Direct-drive plenum fans come with the optional dual arrangement. The multi-fan sets will provide more even air flow and redundancy if one fan should need servicing.


### *Table 1: Dual Fan Width Requirements*

T Extended Cabinet \*Not on 4" width

For redundancy, the rule of thumb is that one fan will provide approximately 65% of the total CFM provided by both fans if the remaining fan is not sped up. If more redundancy is required, then a VFD and larger motor can be used to speed up the single fan to achieve more airflow. The selection software will calculate the redundancy. If a manual calculation is required to calculate the maximum available airflow from the single fan, manually plot the single fan performance onto the dual fan curve as in Figure 7. Extend the single fan rpm line to intersect with the system static pressure line. This balance point shows the performance of a single fan when one fails.

#### *Figure 6: Plenum Fan*

If a VFD is used, the fan can be sped up to the limit of the HP of the motor to get more airflow. To increase redundancy, a larger motor can be selected. Remember that over sized fan motors may be less efficient. This typically occurs below 50- 60% design bhp. If you over size the motor to increase redundancy, as the motor BHP drops farther away from the actual HP, the motor will run less and less efficiently. So, if the application is meant for dual fans, it may be best to simply use the best selection for efficiency and utilize what redundancy comes with this selection. This will ensure the customer will have the most efficient operating setup while having the insurance of good redundancy.

The width of the fans will determine which cabinets will allow certain fans. Table 1 will help by showing what minimum cabinet width and unit size you will need for specific fan diameter selections.

An optional motor removal gantry system is available for the Dual Plenum Fan and Fan Array options. The gantry option provides easier serviceability of motors if access is not available on both sides of the fan section.

14------------------------------------------------



#### *Figure 7: Dual Fan Redundancy – 65% if one fan fails*

Twin fans (two housed forward curved fans mounted on one common shaft) are excellent in both retrofit units and stacked energy recovery units. Twin fans can handle high cfm in very low profile units.

The different types of fans are available in numerous wheel diameters per unit size. The fan size selection is always optimized and identified by the SelectTools software. The program considers performance, efficiency, sound generation and first cost and offers a number of fan sizes to select from. Fan and motor assemblies can be provided with 2" spring (Figure 8), rubber in shear, or rigid mount allowing the customer the option of isolating the fan and motor assembly internally or isolating the entire unit. All fans are dynamically balanced at the plant as an assembly, including the motors and drives. All belt-drive fans rotate on a solid steel shaft of uniform diameter that has been ground, polished, and coated with a rust inhibitor. Fan shafts are selected to have a maximum operating speed well below the first critical speed.

Belt guards are available on plenum fans. Seismic restraint is also available for seismic active locations.

All single-speed motors are standard as premium efficiency, while 2-speed motors are high efficiency.

The fan bearings have a minimum L50 life of 200,000 hours, and are available as high as one million hours. Bearings are selected for minimum noise levels and minimal service. Bearings are self aligning and pre-lubricated for immediate use. Bearings are mounted on rigid frames and positioned to provide proper balance. All bearings include copper lubrication lines that are extended to the access side of the fan cabinet with the grease fittings located near the access door opening.

All fan motors are internally mounted. The appropriate motor size will be selected by the SelectTools software. Motors cannot be undersized, but may be oversized if desired. Motor options include open drip proof, totally enclosed fan cooled, 1 speed/1 winding, 2 speed/1 winding, and 2 speed/2 winding. Motor efficiencies available for high and premium efficiency, depending on the motor type.

#### *Figure 8: Spring Isolation*

15------------------------------------------------



### **Fan Array**

The fan array section will decrease the fan section length by using multiple smaller direct-drive fans. With the stacked array, the fans will also provide a more even airflow pattern throughout the unit and will allow the fans to be placed closer to the coil. Multiple fans also provide redundancy, allowing the system to deliver full airflow and static pressure if a fan or motor is lost. All fans in the fan array are direct-drive and offer more efficient performance with no belt losses and no required shaft bearing maintenance.

The DDPL fan array section has fan diameters from 12–33 inches, with arrangements of up to 24 fans. Daikin Applied offers three motor control options to meet the highest level of redundancy. The array can be selected with a single VFD, a VFD per row or a VFD per fan. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

The ECM fan array section has a brushless, permanent magnet motor(s) for maximum efficiency. The inverter is integral to the motor. Each fan will come with an individual motor starter and optional backdraft prevention allowing complete isolation of any fan.

The optional Microtech 4 DDC controller offers advanced technology with adaptive algorithms making equipment configuration and Daikin Applied ECM fan array management easier. The controller is factory installed on the unit, with the option for remote mounting, and can be configured for constant air volume, variable air volume, or fan tracking applications. Fan performance can be monitored via standard, factory installed airflow measurement. System operation and diagnostic information is readily available via the on-board display, for simple, intuitive troubleshooting.

### **Coils**

The Daikin Applied Vision air handler offers broad application flexibility in coil sections and coils. Coils can be arranged in draw-through, blow-through, and multi-zone configurations. Heating only, cooling only, or cooling and heating sections are available. All coils are installed with space between each coil to allow access for cleaning and mounting of controls.

Cooling coil sections, and cooling and heating coil sections, are available in seven different section lengths to accommodate every application requirement. Drain pans extend the full length of the section. Removable access panels or doors may be provided in the deeper sections that will not interfere with piping connections extending through the unit side panels.

All cooling coils are mounted over a double sloped drain pan. The cooling coil rests on coil supports located over the drain pan. The drain pan extends beyond the leaving side of the coil to help recover condensate. The primary drain pan also extends under the coil headers and return bends to help remove condensate from the unit. A full thickness of insulation is always provided between the drain pan and the bottom outer panel. The drain pan is sloped in two planes to promote proper condensate removal.

Coil connections are grommet sealed inside and outside to ensure low cabinet leakage, and the connections always extend through the unit cabinetry, allowing for the easy connection of valves and piping (Figure 12). Water coil vents and drains are located outside the cabinetry.

Coils are available in a range of face area sizes, including small, medium, medium extended, large, extended and staggered. Generally, small face area coils are used for heating applications, large face area coils are used for cooling applications with bypass, and extended face area coils are used to maximize the unit cross section for restricted space applications. The extended coil is used to maintain coil face velocity limitations to avoid going to a larger cabinet size, saving valuable floor space and money.

With Daikin Applied being a major manufacturer of heat transfer coils, the coil options are virtually unlimited. The Daikin Applied contractor coil line has several coil types, ranging from hot and cold water, refrigerant and steam. Standard Daikin Applied coils are AHRI certified. In addition to a broad range of circuitings, fin spacing and row depths, coils can be constructed of different material types for fins, tubes, connections, and casings. This provides the ability to specify a coil to meet the application requirements.

### **Filters**

The Daikin Applied Vision air handler is designed to house flat, angular, bag, or cartridge filters. These media types range in efficiencies up to 95% and MERV 15. (See Table 2 for a description of the MERV Rating.) In addition to offering a full range of efficiencies, the filter media can be provided with an optional antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial treatments are highly recommended for a complete filtration system.

Daikin Applied Vision air handlers can also ordered with HEPA (MERV 17) filters. These filters have a minimum efficiency of 99.99% – 0.3 mm.

An optional filter pressure gauge may be ordered with each filter section to help promote regular servicing and prevent clogging.

Both bag and cartridge filters have a pre-filter and can be either side load or front load. An access door is provided on either side or both sides of the unit to access the filter section. Filters can be positioned any place in the unit, and as many filter sections as required can be used. Many health and food industries require stringent filtration. Often, a filter section must be the last component in the air stream. The Daikin Applied Vision air handler meets these requirements by providing a filter section located as the last component in the air stream, and with full sheet metal liners.

### **What is the MERV Rating?**

Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV)—ASHRAE Standard 52.2-1999 entitled "Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal by Particle Size" provides a methodology for determining filter efficiency at removing various sizes of particles (see Figure 13) as the filters become loaded. There are three ranges of particle sizes that define the MERV value:

Range 1—0.3 to 1.0 .m particle size.

Range 2—1.0 to 3.0 .m particle size.

Range 3—3.0 to 10.0 .m particle size.

The Table 2 shows a comparison of the MERV rating to the average arrestance percentage by the older ASHRAE Standard 52.1 method:



### *Standard Filter Types Available:*

- MERV 8 2" or 4" depth. Pleated filter with two layers of added polypropylene laminate to increase efficiency.

# **Ultraviolet Light Options**

Vision air handlers can be factory equipped with ultraviolet (UV) light options that are pre-engineered for placement to provide maximum effectiveness. The first can be mounted on the downstream side of all cooling coils and above the unit drain pan for surface "kill" applications to comply with the GSA Facilities Standard for federal buildings. Agency approved to UL Category Code ABQK specification, HVAC Accessories, Air Duct Mounted, in addition to the ETL listing of Vision air handlers.

## **Access**

Access sections can be selected to meet specific application criteria. They can be placed anywhere in a unit in a variety of depths and are available in depths of 16" – 54". Typically, access sections are used for field-installed components, air monitoring devices, or to provide ample space between components.

# **Mixing Boxes and Economizers**

When outside and return air mixing is required, either a mixing box or an economizer section can be selected. Either component will regulate the amount of outside and return air supplied to the conditioned space. The mixing box or economizer can make use of free cooling by opening outside air dampers when the ambient air will help to condition the supply air stream. Additionally, dampers may be individually sized to provide better mixing.

Both the mixing box and economizer are provided with a Daikin Applied UltraSeal™ low leak damper. This damper has one of the lowest leakage rates in the industry, maximizing energy efficiency. At 4.0" static pressure and a face velocity of 1100 fpm through the dampers, the leakage rate is less than 0.2% (it is common to specify leakage rates at higher static pressures, but dampers should not exceed 2" of static pressure). The parallel airfoil blades are hollow core and fully gasketed. Continuous vinyl seals are provided between the damper blades. Stainless steel end seals and linkage built into high strength ABS plastic endcaps provide smooth, quiet operation.

## **Face and Bypass Dampers**

Face and bypass dampers can be provided to modulate temperature by bypassing air around the coil. The opposed blades meter varying air volumes through the coil and bypass to attain the final air temperature demanded. Daikin Applied Vision air handlers offer only low leak dampers in their face and bypass sections.

Three styles of face and bypass sections are available.

- Internal bypass is available for use with medium face area coils (Figure 15).
- External bypass and external right angle are used when larger face area coils are required. The damper blades are fabricated of continuous galvanized steel with the damper rods rotating in nylon bushings. Damper shaft extensions are supplied to facilitate damper motor location.
- Integral face and bypass. Vision air handlers are preengineered to provide an accurate, reliable method of preheating and tempering air in standard or make-up air applications. Integral face and bypass coils maintain constant steam pressure or tube velocities through the coil to help prevent freeze-ups, while varying airflow through the coil using bypass dampers. The amount of air bypassed or heated is determined by a preset leaving air temperature. It can vary from the bypass dampers being fully closed (all air passes through the coil) for maximum heat output, to the bypass dampers being fully open (no air passes through the coil) for minimum heat output. The air is then mixed at the discharge of the coil to achieve the desired leaving air temperature. Air pressure drop is maintained constant regardless of the position of the dampers.

### *Figure 15: Internal Face and Bypass Dampers*

20------------------------------------------------



### **Blenders/Air Mixers**

Stratification can occur from the mixing box when airflow from two different temperature air streams do not mix completely. This incomplete mixing can continue through the air handler and subject an unprotected coil (no glycol) to freezing temperatures, damaging the coil. With the increased minimum outdoor air requirements as identified by ASHRAE Standard 62, the likelihood for air stratification increases. An air handler must be able to handle the required amount of outdoor air, regardless of temperature, without risking damage to the coil.

Blenders/air mixers help to provide protection for coils against freeze-up due to stratification. They add additional turbulence to the passing air streams, boosting the air velocity for improved mixing. Proper distance is provided immediately downstream to give the air streams enough time to fully mix before reaching the next air handler component. Because blenders/air mixers are static devices, they require no maintenance. Different blender/air mixer lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements. The Daikin Applied SelectTools software can help select the appropriate blender/air mixer for the application.

### *Figure 16: Blender*

### **Attenuators**

Building occupants have become increasingly conscious of the quality of their environments, and low sound levels are a key criteria. Studies have confirmed improved productivity when workers are performing in sound-controlled environments. Consequently, building owners, engineers, and architects are designing their projects with stringent sound criteria to maximize this economic benefit.

Daikin Applied Vision air handlers are designed to provide quiet sound levels. Factory-installed attenuators are available for the discharge or return sections of the air handling unit to meet the most stringent sound attenuation requirements. Different attenuator lengths can be selected to satisfy either the acoustic, space, pressure drop, or initial cost requirements. Quality construction and an aerodynamic design give reliable performance, low pressure drop and low initial cost. The Daikin Applied SelectTools Software can help choose the correct attenuator for your application.

#### *Figure 17: Attenuator Section*

# **Digital Ready™ Air Handlers**

Vision Air Handlers can be factory-equipped with industry standard direct digital control (DDC) components for easy, low cost integration with controls by others. Sensors and actuators are selected for maximum compatibility with most DDC control systems, and are neatly wired within their shipping section to a conveniently located junction box. Digital Ready Vision air handlers save the time and costly labor needed to identify, purchase and field install DDC components to match your control system. You also benefit from uniform, proper positioning of DDC components at our factory, which promotes reliable start-up and operation.

21------------------------------------------------



### **Starters and VFDs**

A variety of factory-installed motor control options are available to provide operation and maintenance protection, motor efficiency, and flexibility for the Vision air handler. These options include: Disconnect Switch, Starters, Combination Starter/Disconnect, Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) with Disconnect Switch, and VFD with Disconnect Switch and Bypass. Line reactors are available on both VFD with Disconnect Switch and VFD with Disconnect Switch and Bypass.

A unit mounted disconnect switch provides the means for disconnecting power in sight from the motor when required by the National Electric Code (NEC). The switch is a heavyduty type with a non-fused disconnect switch in a NEMA 1 enclosure. A fused disconnect is also available.

Factory mounted starters offer remote start/stop operation and overload protection for an individual fan motor with minimum field cost to wire line and control circuit power to the unit. All starters provided are NEMA rated. Additional options include auxiliary contacts, control transformer, selector switch, push buttons, and pilot lights. A combination starter is a starter packaged with a safety switch. These motor controllers provide remote start/stop operation as well as disconnecting means in sight of the controller.

A VFD provides adjustable speed control of a single fan motor. Factory mounted outside the fan cabinet, the VFD provides not only a lower cost than field installation, but also an optimal installation location. VFDs are preprogrammed and include a keypad for local or remote control.

A unit installed VFD with disconnect provides local or remote speed control for a single fan motor with disconnecting means within sight when required by the NEC. A non-fused disconnect is offered packaged with the VFD in a separate NEMA 1 enclosure. Installation is limited to the connection of power and control wires at the device.

Packaged VFD with disconnect and bypass offers added motor control at the unit for critical fan applications. With bypass control, power to the VFD can be switched to allow full operation of the fan motor in case of VFD failure. VFDs with disconnect switch, bypass and line reactors provide harmonic control when needed.

## **Energy Recovery**

Maintaining acceptable indoor air quality is generally accomplished by introducing ventilation from outdoors. The air must be conditioned to match the indoor space requirements. Heat wheels and fixed plate heat exchangers are available as factory-installed options for Vision air handlers. These energy recovery components can recover 50% or more of the energy normally exhausted from a building. These devices capture heat from exhaust air as it passes through the air handler and transfer it to the supply air stream, reducing the cost of heating or cooling the outside air. Energy recovery components do this by transferring energy from a warm air stream to a colder air stream—heating cold outside air during the winter and cooling hot air during the summer.

The fixed plate creates a cross flow as it collects heat and conducts it to the other side of the plate. The fixed plate has no moving parts, is easy to clean, has a low pressure drop, can be sealed against cross contamination, and is offered in a wide range of configurations. Flat plate heat exchangers are offered in both sensible-only and enthalpy (sensible and latent) arrangements.

The heat recovery wheel rotates at low speeds, capturing and transferring both sensible (heat) energy and latent (moisture) energy. The ability to transfer both sensible and latent energy gives the heat wheel several advantages. First, the required capacity of ventilation equipment is significantly reduced. Additionally, the heat wheel works at lower temperatures without frosting. The supply air from the heat wheel is not near saturation, and moisture in the ductwork is not an issue.

Further, no condensate pan or drain is required. Finally, heat wheels provide humidification so that the humidifier can be downsized. They also help to keep humidity in spaces where humidification is not applied, providing greater comfort to these zones. Both types of energy recovery devices are configured on the inlets and outlets with splice collars to match the adjacent sections. The fixed plate requires two drip pans..

The side-by-side arrangement will often fit an energy recovery unit into spaces with height restrictions relative to the standard stacked arrangement. For example, if the application requires 9,000 CFM and bypass dampers, the stacked arrangement would require 108" in total height while the side-by-side would only need 72", but will require an added 62" in width. This arrangement will also allow easy access to both supply and return air streams since both are on the same level.

Since the diameter of the energy recovery wheel will often be the limiting factor of the unit height, the selection of the sidebyside arrangement will almost always require custom cabinet dimensions.

22------------------------------------------------



### **Electric Heaters**

Electric heaters extend the versatility of the Vision air handler. With negligible air pressure drop, accurate controllability, light weight, easy serviceability and inherent freeze protection, electric heaters are valuable alternatives to conventional steam and hot water heating coils.

ETL-approved electric heaters are available on all standard sizes (003-090) for horizontally-mounted draw through units in both left and right hand configurations. All units are open wire style construction, with automatic and manual backup limit controls, air switch, stainless steel terminals, power on pilot light, magnetic contactors and integral control boxes. Safety interlock switches, step controllers and vernier silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) are available options.

The heater requires its own electric service. Heaters are available in 208V, 240V, 480V and 600V (all 3 phase) and use an internal 24-volt control circuit. Standard kW ranges are available for each heater size and are designed to give an approximate temperature rise from 20°F to 60°F, depending on the airflow through the unit. Typical pressure drops range from .01 to .04 inches of water, depending on the air velocity and number of rows of heating elements.

An integral control box with optional door handle power disconnect is included with the electric heater. Insulated panels are factory installed behind the control box. The maximum allowable air temperature before circuit trip occurs at 120° F. The heater is assembled into a separate section of the Vision air handler. Standard section widths include 30", 34", 42", and 46" and vary depending on unit size, control type and kW used.

| SMOKE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Improper smoke or fume air handling can result in severe personal injury or death. A registered professional engineer must design and approve the air conditioner and air handler application to make sure smoke and fume control meet local fire codes and NFPA requirements for the specific building application. |



# **Air Handler Selection**

Selecting flexible Vision air handlers depends on many different criteria. The Quick Select tables on page 25 and page 26 provide a rough determination of air handler needs. To simplify this process, Daikin Applied designed an innovative computerized selection program—Daikin Applied SelectTools software. It allows the user to develop an air handler from the ground up and obtain all of the detail required for proper design and specification. The user can design a unit in a matter of minutes.

The program is completely integrated. All input data is carried through the selection process and considered as calculations are made. Because the program is integrated, the opportunity for errors is reduced. The software guides the user through the selection process. On-line editing helps select only viable options. The program is provided so that even the less experienced user can select air handlers accurately.

Designing an efficient air handler system depends on accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that affect unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation requirements, heating and cooling space loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and thermal media and installation limitations. Unit selection can be broken down into four steps: unit type and size, coils, accessories, and fan and motor requirements.

Generally, the unit is selected based on the air volume required and the desired face velocity through the cooling coil. For cooling coils, 400 to 525 feet per minute is considered the optimum face velocity range for dehumidification and the prevention of any moisture carryover. The Daikin Applied SelectTools software recommends the unit size based on air flow and face velocity requirements. Once the unit size is determined, select the coils and all accessory components. Once all components and coils are selected (identifying the total internal component pressure drop), select the fan.

### **Selecting Coils**

The Vision air handler provides the ability to select from multiple face area coils per unit size. Once the coil size is selected, the row and fin requirements can be determined based on performance criteria. Daikin Applied offers an extensive line of coil types and circuitings. This wide variety of circuiting, row, and fin spacing, in addition to different material types, can provide a coil selection that handles the load required.

Heating, cooling, and combination cooling and reheat sections are available. Coil sections come in many different depths to accommodate multiple rows of coils, and to provide access on the leaving air side or between coils for cleaning and inspection of the drain pan. Access in the coil section can be minimized or maximized depending on the space available and job needs. Coil sections can be placed as needed in the unit, and as many sections as required for conditioning of air can be provided.

### **Selecting Accessories**

A complete selection of component and section types in a variety of unit arrangements and configurations is available for air mixing, filtration, and temperature control to meet specific application requirements. The outside and/or return air can be brought into the unit through a plenum, mixing box, or economizer. For mixing of the two air streams, dampers are required to modulate and direct outside and return air, which is accomplished using a mixing box or economizer. Both section types use the Daikin Applied patented UltraSeal™ low leak dampers. Blenders/air mixers also are available to provide proper mixing of two air streams, to prevent stratification and to help avoid damage to equipment due to freezing temperatures.

To promote good air filtration, many different filter media types and arrangements are offered. Filters can be provided in angular or flat filter racks, a variety of media efficiencies, and with or without a prefilter. The filter section can be located anywhere in the unit to filter air as it enters the unit, or in a final filter arrangement before it leaves the unit. Bag or cartridge filters can be either front or side loading.

Also available are many different size access sections for field-installed components or to provide access between components. Other options include diffusers, plenums, face and bypass dampers, sound attenuators, and blenders/air mixers. Standard access doors open outward for maximum accessibility to internal components.

On pressurized sections, most doors open inward to help maintain the extremely low cabinet leakage rate of the Vision unit and to prevent doors from being inadvertently opened when the cabinet is under pressure.

### **Selecting Fans**

### **WARNING**

#### SMOKE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Improper smoke or fume air handling can result in severe personal injury or death. A registered professional engineer must design and approve the air conditioner and air handler application to make sure smoke and fume control meet local fire codes and NFPA requirements for the specific building application.

Fan selection requires an accurate calculation of the resistance to the airflow through the entire system. This total resistance consists of the sum of two parts—the external and internal static pressure. The external static pressure is the static pressure found in the distribution system, external to the air handler. The internal unit resistance is the sum of the resistance of the coils and various other unit components and accessories. Component pressure drops are listed for specific air flows in this catalog.

Use the Daikin Applied SelectTools software to determine internal component pressure drops of the system. Once the total static pressure is known, the software identifies the fans available to properly handle the air flow and static pressure for the system. The software generates a full fan curve based on the fan selection and point of operation.

# **Application Considerations**

### **Installation Flexibility**

Daikin Applied central station Vision air handlers feature sectionalized design and can ship fully assembled or in sections as required by the job site condition to provide maximum installation flexibility. Multiple fan, coil, filter, mixing box, face and bypass, and access components allow the design flexibility of built-up systems with the cost advantage of factory fabricated units. Units can be shipped from the factory in as few or as many sections as required according to job site condition.

### **Mounting and Access**

Whether units are floor or ceiling mounted, take care to keep the supporting structure level and rigid enough for satisfactory unit operation. Ideally, a heavy concrete slab should be used for floor mounted units and main support beams should be used for ceiling supported units. Ceiling suspended units must be trapeezed from the unit base rail or field-supplied materials. Avoid long floor or ceiling spans.

Locate units so there is proper access for routine service. Clearance for filter removal on both sides of the filter section is usually necessary. Provide clearance as required for access panels. Allow room for coil removal. Cooling units require clearance for a trap in the drain pan line.

Access to the interior of the Vision air handler is provided by hinged access doors or removable panels. For access between components, versatile access sections feature hinged access doors on either or both sides.

### **Ductwork**

A well-designed duct layout minimizes system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow. Avoid discharge plenums or any abrupt change in duct size. Also avoid sharp turns in the fan discharge, particularly turns opposed to wheel rotation. If sharp bends are necessary, use turning vanes. See Figure 18 for good fan outlet practices.

**NOTE:** Elbows should not be closer than 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the largest dimension of fan discharge opening. Place dampers at least 3 fan diameters downstream of the fan discharge.

27------------------------------------------------



### **Piping and Drain Pan Traps**

Design and install piping in accordance with accepted industry standards. Do not apply undue stress at the connection to coil headers. Support pipe work independently of the coils with adequate piping flexibility for thermal expansion. Run drain lines and traps full size from the drain pan connection. Drain pans must have traps to allow the condensate from the coils to drain freely. On a draw-through unit, the trap depth and the distance between the trap outlet and drain pan outlet should be twice the negative static pressure under normal unit operation. See Figure 19.

#### *Figure 19: Drain Pan Traps*

### **Vibration Isolation**

To help keep noise and vibration compatible with the intended use of the conditioned air space, apply good acoustical and vibration engineering practices during the early stages of design.

Since most applications require vibration isolation, the Vision air handler is available with factory-installed internal isolation. Internally isolated units feature spring or rubber in shear isolators sized specifically for each fan wheel and unit size.

### **Multi-zone Air Handler Applications**

Blow-through air handlers are available in singlezone, twodeck, and three-deck configurations. The two-deck and threedeck units are offered with or without zone dampers. All unit configurations include a perforated plate fan discharge diffuser to provide even airflow downstream of the fan.

Multi-zone and dual duct air handlers typically provide comfort conditioning by distributing a constant air volume at variable temperature. In a typical system, a portion of the air is heated by passing through the heating coil; the balance is cooled by the cooling coil. The heated and cooled airstreams are then mixed in the required proportion to provide the optimum temperature air to the conditioned space.

For dual duct applications, a pair of ducts bring heated and cooled air to the air mixing terminal boxes where the airstreams are mixed. By adding zone dampers to the dual duct unit, the air mixing takes place at the unit discharge and only one duct is required to distribute conditioned air to the building. The air mixing terminal boxes also are eliminated.

By adding a third bypass deck to the hot and cold decks, a triple deck multi-zone is created. The triple deck configuration offers significant energy conservation opportunities by allowing return or outside air to bypass both coils. The thermal inefficiency of mixing heated and cooled air is eliminated by the addition of the bypass deck. Bypass air is mixed with heated air for building zones that require heating. Bypass air is mixed with cooled air for building zones that require cooling.

Multi-zone air handling systems result in an absence of water, steam and condensate drain piping, wiring, electrical and mechanical equipment in the conditioned space for more usable commercial floor area and higher rental income.

### **Sound**

The unit inlet, outlet, and radiated sound levels for each octave band are calculated by the Daikin Applied SelectTools software, based on your specific application. Sound performance data is derived from testing performed in accordance with AMCA Standard 300. The effects of various components, casework, and unit configurations are taken into account.

### **Air Supply Systems and Fan Laws**

An air supply system consists of an air handler cabinet, heat exchanger, filters, ductwork, grilles and registers used to distribute air throughout the building. The system is independent of the fan used to supply the system.

The resistance of the system, referred to as static pressure (SP), is dependent upon the quantity of air (cfm) that is moved through it. The air quantity is determined by the cooling, heating, and ventilating requirements.

For any system, the static pressure varies directly as the square of the air quantity. This relationship between cfm and SP establishes the system curve for that system and is expressed as follows:

$$\left(\frac{\text{cfm}\_1}{\text{cfm}\_2}\right)^2 = \frac{\text{SP}\_1}{\text{SP}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{SP}\_2 \quad = \text{ SP}\_1 \quad \left(\frac{\text{cfm}\_2}{\text{cfm}\_1}\right)^2$$

The system curve is unique for a particular system configuration. Any change to the system caused by dirty filters, damper changes, etc., results in a new system curve.

For fans operating at low pressures (less than 10" W.G.), the effects of air compression are negligible. Disregarding air compression allows fan operation in a fixed system to be expressed by simple relationships. These relationships are known as fan laws and can be used to calculate the effects of fan speed and air density changes on this system.

**1** The flow rate varies directly with the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\text{cfm}\_1}{\text{cfm}\_2} = \frac{\text{rpm}\_1}{\text{rpm}\_2} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{cfm}\_2 = \text{cfm}\_1 \left(\frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1}\right)$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases air quantity 10%.

**2** The static pressure varies as the square of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\mathfrak{SP}\_1}{\mathfrak{SP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_1}{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_2}\right)^2 \text{or} \quad \mathfrak{SP}\_2 = \mathfrak{SP}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_2}{\mathfrak{r}\mathfrak{M}\_1}\right)^2$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases static pressure 21%.

**3** The fan brake horsepower varies as the cube of the change in fan speed:

$$\frac{\mathsf{HP}\_1}{\mathsf{HP}\_2} = \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}\right)^3 \text{ or } \mathsf{HP}\_2 = \mathsf{HP}\_1 \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_2}{\mathsf{rpm}\_1}\right)^3$$

A 10% increase in fan speed increases horsepower 33%.

**4** System static pressure and brake horsepower are directly proportional to the air density:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathsf{SP}\_{2} & = & \mathsf{SP}\_{1} \quad \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{density}\_{2}}{\mathsf{density}\_{1}}\right) & \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_{2}}{\mathsf{rpm}\_{1}}\right)^{3} \\\\ \mathsf{HP}\_{2} & = & \mathsf{HP}\_{1} \quad \quad \left(\frac{\mathsf{density}\_{2}}{\mathsf{density}\_{1}}\right) & \left(\frac{\mathsf{rpm}\_{2}}{\mathsf{rpm}\_{1}}\right)^{3} \end{array}$$

Consequently, the static pressure and brake horsepower decrease with an increase in air temperature or higher altitude, and increase with a decrease in air temperature or lower altitude.

To determine fan performance for temperatures and altitudes other than standard (70°F, 0 ft. altitude), the static pressure must be adjusted by the density ratio before the fan rpm and bhp requirements can be determined. Density ratios are expressed as temperature and altitude conversion factors in Table 5.


#### *Figure 21: Fan and Motor Heat Gain*

### **Fan and Motor Heat**

**Motor and drive heat**—The total energy input to any fan motor is consumed in two ways: by heat dissipated through the motor frame and by work output. The amount of heat dissipated by the motor is a function of its operating efficiency:

*Motor heat = input × (1 – motor efficiency)* 

A small amount of the motor work output is dissipated by the drive mechanism, which also results in a heat gain. Belt-drive losses are a function of belt tension and number of belts as well as power transmitted. Typical belt-drive losses range from 2% to 6% of bhp.

Whether motor and drive heat gain become part of an air handling system cooling load depends on the motor location relative to the conditioned space. For air handlers with internal motors, the motor and drive are within the conditioned space. Therefore, the motor and drive add heat to the system. Subtract this heat from the cooling capacity and add it to the heating capacity of the unit.

**Fan heat generation**—All of the power input to a fan results in heat gain, which must be considered as a cooling load. The amount of heat generated is directly proportional to the fan bhp:

#### *Fan heat (Btuh) = bhp × 2545*

Much of this heat generation occurs within the fan itself. Fans are not 100% efficient, and the energy losses that occur convert directly into heat. The work done by the fan on the airstream increases the temperature, pressure, and velocity of air. The heat of compression required to raise the airstream to this increased energy level is also a heat gain.

As the air travels throughout the building, its energy is deteriorated by friction, resulting in pressure drop. This is also heat gain, but it does not result in temperature rise because the air expands as the pressure is reduced. The expansion is a cooling process that offsets the heat generated by friction.

Typical fan and motor heat values are given in Figure 21.

30------------------------------------------------



### **Variable Air Volume**

Daikin Applied variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This true variable volume system is commonly referred to as a "squeeze-off" or "pinch-off" system. Unlike a "bypass" or "dump" system, supply air is diverted from areas where it is not required to areas that need cooling and, at system part load conditions, reduces the total fan volume. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lowers system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes.
- Lowers operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions.
- Lowers first cost by reducing space requirements for duct trunks and mechanical equipment.
- Provides system flexibility to match changing occupancy demands.

### **Variable Frequency Drives**

Variable frequency drives offer reliable operation over a wide range of airflow, with advantages in sound and energy performance.

Variable frequency drives provide the most efficient means of variable volume control by taking advantage of the fan law relation between fan speed (rpm) and fan brake horsepower (bhp). Also, since airflow is reduced by changing fan speed, the noise penalties often associated with mechanical control devices, e.g. inlet vanes, are not introduced. The following equation illustrates how fan bhp varies as the cube of the change in fan speed: :

$$\mathsf{HP}\_2 = \begin{array}{c} \mathsf{HP}\_1 \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{c} \mathsf{density}\_2 \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{c} \mathsf{clensity}\_2 \\ \end{array} \end{array} \right\} $$

In an ideal system, at 50% fan speed, brake horsepower would be reduced to 12.5% of that at full speed.

Variable frequency control varies the speed of the fan by adjusting the frequency and voltage to the motor. Keeping a constant volts/frequency ratio (constant magnetic flux) to the motor allows the motor to run at its peak efficiency over a wide range of speeds and resulting fan airflow volumes. Figure 22 illustrates on a fan curve the effect of varying air volume with a variable frequency drive.

#### *Table 12: Base Rail Weights*


**Notes**:

• Weight factor for 6" high rail = .52 lb/in (.00929 kg/mm) • Weight factor for 10" high rail = .74 lb/in (.0132 kg/mm)

The base rail weight is determined by adding together the weight of the rail supports that run the length and width of the unit. The lengthwise support depends on the overall unit length. The cross member weight is dependent on the number of cross channels needed to support the unit. Each shipping section has a cross member located on each end. When a unit ships in one piece, the rail will have 2 end channel supports. When the unit ships in numerous shipping sections, each shipping section will have two end pieces. Fan, coil, and attenuator sections each must have additional cross member support on the entering and leaving air side of the section. If the coil section is adjacent to a fan, only one cross member is provided between them. A heating only coil section must have an additional cross member support on the entering air side. Any shipping section over 8' long requires an additional cross member.

Base rails are required on sizes 025 and above.

#### **Example:**

Determine the weight of a 6" high base rail for a size 8 unit that is 108" long, consisting of a fan, access, coil, and angular filter in a single shipping section.

Weight factor for unit length for a 6" curb is .52 lb/in

*108" × 0.52 lb/in = 56.0 lb . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56 lb*

Weight of end cross members for each shipping section is 41 lb each pair.

*1 × 41.0 lb = 41.0 lb. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 lb*

Weight of additional cross members to support fan and coil sections. In this example the fan and coil are separated by an access section; therefore four extra cross member pieces are required for the fan and coil.

### **Multi-zone Coils**

The face area of the multi-zone cold deck coil is the same as other cooling coils shown in Table 18 on page 48. Multi-zone hot deck coils have a face area that is different from other heating coils. The face area for the multi-zone hot deck is generally smaller.

The minimum section depth for multi-zone sections is shown starting on page 69. Additional access is available downstream from the cooling coil. Refer to Daikin Applied SelectTools Software for more detailed information.

### **Belt-drive Plenum Fan Discharge**

*Table 29: Belt-drive Plenum Fan Dimensions* 


\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

A 6" (152 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065. An 8" (203 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 080 and larger.

\*\* This value represents the height for an optional top plenum. Additional discharge openings include axial, top and single opening, opposite drive side, bottomsingle opening, split and removable panels. Use Daikin Applied SelectTools software for more detailed dimensional information.

### **Direct-Drive Plenum Fan Discharge**

#### *Table 32: Direct-drive Plenum Fan Dimensions*


\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

A 6" (152 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065. An 8" (203 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 080 and larger.

\*\* This value is dependent on motor frame size.

### **Coil Section**

### **Cooling Coil Section**

The single cooling coil section is available in numerous depths. This provides the option of varying the amount of space downstream from the coil for access to inspect and clean the coil and drain pan. When using a single bank of coils, the 18" deep section holds up to a 4-row water or DX coil.

Also available are staggered cooling coils. The staggered arrangement maximizes the cooling coil face area by providing two banks of coils. These two coils are not stacked, but are staggered in the direction of airflow. This configuration does require more section depth in the direction of airflow. Staggered coils are only available on unit sizes 025 and larger.

The section depth required varies between 30" to 54". This depends on the unit size and number of rows in the coil.

When a coil section is used in a vertical application, the section must be deep enough to support the fan above it and keep the face velocity through the top opening below 1000 fpm. The coil section should be a minimum of 36" deep in direction of airflow. As the fan and airflow get larger, it may be necessary to add a plenum downstream from the coil section. Drain connections for units with width A greater than 108", in Table 34, are 1.50 MPT.\*


#### *Table 34: Cooling Coil Dimensions*

\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height. A 6" (152 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065. An 8" (203 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 080 and larger.

### **Combination Cooling and Reheat Coil Section**

The combination cooling and reheat coil section is available in numerous depths. This provides the option of varying the amount of space between the cooling coil and reheat coil for access to inspect and clean the coil and drain pan. All reheat and most cooling coils are arranged in a single bank, which can be 1, 2 or 3 coils high. When using a single bank of cooling coils, the 24" deep section holds up to a 4-row water or DX coil, and a 1-row or 2-row heating coil. A 36" deep section holds a 12-row water coil and a 1 or 2-row reheat coil.

Also available are staggered cooling coils. The staggered arrangement maximizes the cooling coil face area by providing two banks of coils. These two coils are not stacked, but are staggered in the direction of airflow. This configuration does require more section depth in the direction of airflow. Staggered coils are available only on unit sizes 025 and larger. The section depth required varies between 30" to 54". This depends on the unit size and number of rows in the coil.


*Table 35: Combination Cooling and Reheat Coil Dimensions* 

\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height.

A 6" (152 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025-065. An 8" (203 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 080 and larger.

When a combination coil section is used in a vertical application, a plenum must be provided on the leaving air side of the coil. The plenum is used for discharging air into the bottom of the fan section. Drain connections for units with width A greater than 108", in , are 1.50 MPT.\*

\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. A base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height. A base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 02 to 065 and adds a minimum of 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. Unit sizes greater than 080 require a base rail that adds a minimum of 8" (203 mm) to the unit height.

\*\* For 10-row water and DX coils, the C and D dimensions are 6" longer. If additional access is required downstream from the cooling coil, refer to Daikin Applied SelectTools software for available selection options.

\* These are the dimensions of the unit only. Curb-ready base adds 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to the width, and between 4" to 12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to the unit height. A base rail—mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065—adds a minimum of 6" (152 mm) to the unit height. Unit sizes greater than 080 require a base rail that adds a minimum of 8" (203 mm) to the unit height.

### **Blenders**

**NOTE:** The depth of an air mixer section varies depending on components adjacent to the mixing device. The catalog dimensions shown are for a two-blender system except sizes 040 to 090, which are threeblender systems. For applications other than this, the depth dimension varies. Use Vision Select Tools software for more detailed dimensional information.

### **Access Doors**

Access doors are an option for most sections. Fan sections are always provided with a door on one side of the unit. Access door size varies with the size of the section; they are never wider than 30". On most components doors can be selected as inward opening. Once the door is opened outward, the opening is 2" less than the door height and width because there is a 1" flange around the opening. Once the door is opened inward, the opening is 3" less than the door height and width since there is no flange around the opening. Door height is always 4" shorter than section height unless the section has a drain connection. If the section has a drain pan, then the door is 6" shorter than the section height. The maximum door height is 64", except filter section doors, which are equal to section height minus 4".

#### *Table 51: Access Door Dimensions*


#### *Table 52: Door Widths*


\* Filter access doors are the "B" dimension minus 6ʺ.

A standard base rail adds 8" (203 mm) to width and between 4" to12" (102 mm to 305 mm) to unit height. A 6" (152 mm) base rail is mandatory on unit sizes 025 to 065. An 8" (203 mm) base rail is mandatory on all sizes 080 and larger.

gaseous substances. Alternate air-manipulative or catalytic type cleaners shall not be approved (i.e. plasma cleaners, ionizers, etc.)

- E. Solution shall not emit Ozone and/or Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) of any kind; processes and mechanisms that emit ozone/ROS or have the potential to emit ozone or ROS are not acceptable.
- F. Solution shall have the capability to be automatically regenerated (self-cleaned) in-situ; replacement of cleaning mechanism or sorbent media shall not be required more than once per year.
- G. Gas-phase cleaning efficiencies must meet the following minimums for single-pass air cleaning of the following contaminants of concern:
- Carbon Dioxide to have a measured standard challenge concentration of 1000 ppb, with a cartride efficiency of 57%.
- Formaldehyde to have a measured standard challenge concentration of 121 ppb, with a cartride efficiency of 55%.
- H. Cartridge Bank:

The cartridge bank shall house twelve (12) quantity cartridges that contain the sorbents used to capture molecular level contaminants (CO2, formaldehyde, VOCs, ozone, etc. as defined by ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016) during the sorption (cleaning) process and then released during the regeneration (airflow purge or exhaust) process.

I. Heater:

An integrated heater shall raise the internal temperature of the unit to initiate the release of captured contaminants by molecular thermal excitation. The heater shall be controlled using a PID controller loop to maintain the internal temperature. Temperature control shall be an on-board softwarebased function. Controller shall contain 3-modes of safety protection with respect to heater control that are mechanical in nature to ensure safe operation:

- An airflow switch that ensures the heater is disabled when there is insufficient airflow inside the unit.
- A resettable thermal switch shall disconnect the heater when the temperature exceeds a preset limit and will only allow the heater to operate once a safe temperature has been reached.
- A one-time blow fuse shall permanently disconnect the heater in the event the two primary safety functions fail to work.
- J. Fans:

Integrated DC brushless motor driven fans shall control airflow through the unit during the adsorption and regeneration cycles. The fans are controlled using pulse width modulation for variable speed and are safety listed. The fan motors shall contain on-board locked rotor protection to prevent damage to the unit in the event of motor failure or the fan becomes blocked or locked in position.

K. Inlets & Outlets: The module shall include airflow damper inlets and airflow damper outlets controlled and modulated by mechanical actuator assemblies.

L. Internal Damper:

An internal shunt damper shall be used during the regeneration cycle to enable the system to reach and maintain optimal temperature using airflow recirculation and mixing. The internal damper shall be controlled by an actuator allowing for analog position control to actively modulate the amount of recirculation during the regeneration.

M. Control Board:

The electronic enclosure shall contain both the power supply and main controller board.
