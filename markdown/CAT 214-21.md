# **R-410A Refrigerant**

- R-410A refrigerant is an environmentally friendly HFC refrigerant with zero ozone depletion.
- R-410A efficiency is excellent. Daikin Applied R-410A rooftop units are available with EERs that exceed ASHRAE 90.12004. Alternative HFC refrigerants like R-407C inevitably force the unit to be significantly less efficient or more expensive, while R-410A reduces energy costs.
- R-410A refrigerant is a blend, but the glide is negligible. This is not true for R-407C. If R-407C leaks, the remaining charge may not have a proper mix of components. R-410A does not have this problem so leaks are easier to repair.
- Microchannel condensers are used on all of these rooftop units. The condensers are much more robust and corrosion resistant than traditional copper tube and aluminum fin coils. Microchannel condensers also have smaller diameter tubes so they require less refrigerant. Daikin Applied microchannel condensers last longer than competitive condensers and are perfect for LEED buildings.

# **Superior Efficiency**

- Energy costs continue to increase so better rooftop efficiency is extremely important to the building owner. Daikin Applied offers several levels of efficiency including some of the most efficient units on the market.
- Federal EPACT laws regulate rooftop minimum EERs up to 760 MBH and require ASHRAE 90.1-2010 compliance. Local codes regulate EERs above 760 MBH and either ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and ASHRAE 90.1-2010 are generally used.
- Utility rebates oftem provide owners with tremendous incentives to purchase units with premium EERs that are well above ASHRAE 90.1 minimum values. Many utility rebates are based on CEE Tiers I and II EERs.
- Daikin Applied offers three levels of rooftop EERs to meet all of the above requirements as shown in the chart ([Figure 2](#page-8-1)) and data ([Table 1\)](#page-8-2).

# **Microchannel Condensers**

Microchannel coils are an all-aluminum construction composed of:

- 1. Extended flat tubes ([Figure 3](#page-8-3)) with many small flow channels.
- 2. Flat fins ([Figure 3](#page-8-3)) that are brazed to adjoining tubes.
- 3. Two refrigerant manifold headers ([Figure 3](#page-8-3)) that are arranged in a two-pass configuration ([Figure 4](#page-8-4)).
- Flat tubes have better fluid-to-tube heat transfer. Therefore, microchannel coils have more heat transfer per square foot than traditional coils and require much less refrigerant charge per ton of cooling.
- All aluminum construction eliminates galvanic corrosion associated with dissimilar metals. All aluminum coils are much more resistant to normal condenser corrosion in any location including the sea coast.
- Epoxy and UV coated coil cooling option is recommended for seacoast or other corrosive applications and ambient environments.
- Aluminum is lighter than copper, so Daikin Applied R-410A condensers are lighter than competitive condensers.
- Microchannel coils were pioneered in the auto industry and one reason is their more robust construction. Fins are brazed between adjoining tubes so there are no exposed and vulnerable edges. Fin damage is therefore virtually eliminated.

- All evaporator coils feature interlaced circuiting to keep the full face of the coil active and eliminate air temperature stratification
- Long-life painted, galvanized steel or stainless steel, sloped (1/8-in./ft. incline) drain pans. An intermediate drain pan in the coil bank helps to provide condensate removal without carryover
- 3, 4, or 5 row evaporator coils with 8, 10, or 12 fins/inch spacing allow a custom match to specific design loads. Multiple coil face areas allow units to be properly matched to wide ranging conditions from 100% outside air to high cfm comfort cooling applications

## *Figure 5: Extended Face Area Coils*

10------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-10-0"></span># **Modulating Hot Gas Reheat**

In a packaged rooftop system, hot refrigerant gas leaving the compressor can be channeled to a separate coil to reheat the air leaving the cooling coil, as pictured below. This reheat costs no energy and is an excellent way to optimize dehumidification.

For best performance, Daikin Applied precisely controls or modulates the supply of the hot gas to the reheat coil. This modulation helps to maintain a constant, desired supply air temperature. Without it, supply air temperatures can vary significantly as the unit's compressors cycle ON and OFF. See [Figure 6](#page-10-1).

# *Typical Applications*

- 100% Outdoor Air units providing neutral air for terminal unit systems, including fan coils and VRV DX systems, and supplying spaces with large ventilation requirements, such as hospitals and laboratories. See [Figure 8](#page-11-1)
- Large single-zone applications, especially with dense occupancy, such as churches, theaters and gyms. These systems cannot dehumidify at part-load without reheat because DX coil latent air temperatures rise at part load. See [Figure 9](#page-11-2)

# *Features*

• MicroTech controls with integrated compressor and reheat control. Reheat is automatically energized whenever dehumidification is needed.Modulating valves on both the condenser coil and reheat coil for more precise modulation

- Enhancements on RoofPak systems that allow +/-1 degree of supply air temperature control. These include an averaging discharge sensor and VFDs that modulate condenser fan speed and maintain a constant head pressure
- Microchannel reheat and condenser coils, which are more robust than traditional fin-tube coils and more resistant to corrosion. Flat tubes and microchannel flow allow more heat transfer per square foot of coil. And, because microchannel coils require far less charge, refrigeration service is less expensive. No receivers or oil flushing cycles are required and subcooling is always provided

# *Benefits*

- Effective humidity control without using additional energy to reheat the cooled air.Without hot gas reheat, a separate heating system would be required to reheat the cooled, dehumidified air to the desired level, which often violates ASHRAE 90.1-2007 guidelines. Or, higher humidity levels would have to be accepted in the conditioned space
- More consistent humidity and temperature control in the conditioned space. Through compressor control, Daikin Applied systems maintain a constant dew point in the air leaving the cooling coil (beware of inferior competitive alternatives). By modulating the hot gas to the reheat coil, Daikin Applied systems are able to maintain a constant leaving air temperature. See [Figure 6](#page-10-1)

# <span id="page-16-1"></span>**Variable Air Volume**

Daikin Applied RoofPak variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This true variable volume system is commonly referred to as a "squeeze-off" or "pinch-off" system. Unlike a "bypass" or "dump" system, supply air is diverted from areas where it is not required to areas that need cooling and, at system part load conditions, reduces the total fan volume. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing.

Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lowers system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes
- Lowers operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions
- Lowers first cost by reducing space requirements for duct trunks and mechanical equipment
- Provides system flexibility to match changing occupancy demands

# **Variable Frequency Drives**

Variable frequency drives offer reliable operation over a wide range of airflow, with advantages in sound and energy performance.

Variable frequency drives provide the most efficient means of variable volume control by taking advantage of the fan law relation between fan speed (rpm) and fan brake horsepower (bhp). Also, since airflow is reduced by changing fan speed, the noise penalties often associated with mechanical control devices, e.g. inlet vanes, are not introduced. The following equation illustrates how fan bhp varies as the cube of the

$$\begin{array}{c} \text{change in fan speed:}\\ \text{hp}\_2 = \text{hp}\_1 \left( \frac{\text{density}\_2}{\text{density}\_1} \right) \left( \frac{\text{rpm}\_2}{\text{rpm}\_1} \right)^3 \end{array}$$

17------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-17-0"></span>In an ideal system, at 50% fan speed, brake horsepower would be reduced to 12.5% of that at full speed.

Variable frequency control varies the speed of the fan by adjusting the frequency and voltage to the motor. Keeping a constant volts/frequency ratio (constant magnetic flux) to the motor allows the motor to run at its peak efficiency over a wide range of speeds and resulting fan airflow volumes. [Figure 21](#page-17-1) illustrates on a fan curve the effect of varying air volume with a variable frequency drive.

## *Figure 20: Variable Frequency Drive*

<span id="page-17-1"></span># **Airfoil Fans**

To further enhance VAV system performance, Daikin Applied RoofPak VAV systems use efficient airfoil fan selections. Daikin Applied airfoil fan selections feature:

- Higher operating efficiencies than commonly used forward curved fans, reducing system energy demands and electrical requirements

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Components**

Each RoofPak applied rooftop system is equipped with a complete MicroTech unit control system that is preengineered, preprogrammed, and factory tested prior to shipment. These components include:

- Unit controller with user interface display and navigation wheel
- Optional expansion modules
- Communication module (optional)
- Pressure transducers
- Unit-mounted temperature sensors
- Zone temperature sensor packages
- Humidity sensor

## *Expansion Modules*

These boards are used to expand the input and output capability of the unit controller. Each board communicates via serial data communications. These microprocessor based boards provide independent operation and alarm response even if communication is lost with the unit controller.

# *Communication Module*

An optional field- or factory-mounted BACnet or LonWorks communication module provides the means to configure MicroTech unit controls for interoperability with an independent BAS. Communication modules are available to support industry recognized communication protocols including BACnet MS/TP, BACnet/IP and LonWorks.

# *Temperature and Humidity Sensors*

With the exception of the zone sensor, all temperature sensors are factory installed and tested. Zone sensor packages are available to suit any application. When required for dehumidification applications, a humidity sensor is available for field installation.

**Daikin Rebel® Rooftop**

# *Static Pressure Transducers*

All pressure transducers are factory installed and tested. Connection and routing of field-supplied sampling tubes is done at time of unit installation.

# *Zone Temperature Sensors*

Two optional zone temperature sensors are available:

- Zone sensor with tenant override switch.
- Zone sensor with tenant override switch and remote set point adjustment.

Timed tenant override is a standard MicroTech control feature.

Zone sensors are required for the controller's purge cycle, space reset of supply air set point, and night setback or setup features. All zone sensors are field installed with field wiring terminated at a separate, clearly marked terminal strip.

21------------------------------------------------



# **Stand-alone Controller Features**

MicroTech applied rooftop unit controls include all of the essential features required to make them capable of completely independent, stand-alone operation.

# *Internal Time Clock*

An internal, battery-backed time clock is included in the MicroTech unit controller. Current date and time can be quickly and easily set at the user interface keypad.

# *Internal Schedule*

Seven daily schedules and one holiday schedule can be entered at the keypad of all unit controllers. For each of these eight schedules, one start and one stop time can be entered. Up to 10 holiday periods, of any duration, can be designated. The unit will automatically run according to the holiday schedule on the holiday dates. To handle special occasions, an additional 'one event' schedule can also be used.

In lieu of its internal schedule, the unit can be operated according to a network schedule from a BAS.

# *External Time Clock or Tenant Override Input*

An input is supplied that can be used to accept a field wired start/stop signal from a remote source. An external time clock, a tenant override switch, or both may be connected. Whenever the external circuit is closed, the controller overrides the internal schedule (if activated) and places the unit into the occupied mode.

If the internal schedule or a BAS network schedule is used, field wiring is not required.

# *Timed Tenant Override*

Off-hour operation flexibility is a must in today's office environments and even stand-alone MicroTech controls handle it with ease. When unit operation is desired during unoccupied hours, initiate timed tenant override by pressing the tenant override button on either of the optional zone sensor packages. The unit then starts and runs in the occupied mode for a keypad-adjustable length of time (up to five hours). If the button is pressed again while the unit is operating, the timer resets to the full time allowance without interrupting unit operation. Tenant override operation also can be initiated by a BAS.

## *Three Remote Set Point Adjustment Options*

- 1. Remote user interface option (RUI). See [Variable Air](#page-16-1)  [Volume on page 17.](#page-16-1)
- 2. Building automation system (BAS). See [Components on](#page-20-0)  [page 21.](#page-20-0)
- 3. All constant air volume-zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC) unit controllers include an input that can be used to remotely adjust the zone cooling and heating set points. To use this feature, wire the optional zone sensor package with set point adjustment to the controller. The remote set point adjustment feature can be enabled or disabled from the keypad at any time. When enabled, remote set point adjustment is available even if the return temperature is selected to be the Control Temperature.

# *Auto/Manual Operation Selection*

Automatic or manual operation can be controlled either remotely or at the keypad.

All controllers include three inputs that can be used to enable or disable cooling, heating, and fan operation from remote switches. With the "heat enable" and "cool enable" terminals, the operator can enable cooling, heating, or both as desired. Using the system "off" terminals, the operator can disable the fans, and thus the entire unit.

From the keypad, there are a variety of occupancy and auto/ manual control mode selections available to the operator:

- Occupancy modes
	- Auto
	- Occupied
	- Unoccupied
	- Bypass (tenant override)
- Control modes
	- Off manual
	- Auto
	- Heat/cool
	- Cool only
	- Heat only
	- Fan only

# *Compressor Lead-lag Selection*

All unit controllers are capable of automatic compressor, leadlag control. If automatic control is not desired, the operator can assign fixed lead and lag designations to the compressor circuits.

Lead and Lag is not available on units with variable speed inverter compressors.

22------------------------------------------------



# *Compressor Sequencing Selection*

Because all applications are not the same, MicroTech controls provide two choices for compressor capacity staging. For high sensible demand, comfort cooling applications, "cross-circuit" unloading can be chosen to maximize part load efficiency. Cross circuit unloading takes maximum advantage of available condenser and evaporator surface areas. Select "lead-loading" whenever part load dehumidification capability is of primary importance.

# *Economizer Changeover Selection*

On units equipped with an economizer, there are three methods of determining whether the outdoor air is suitable for free cooling: two methods sense enthalpy (dry bulb temperature and humidity) and one senses outdoor air dry bulb temperature.

The two enthalpy changeover methods use external, factory installed controls. One compares the outdoor ambient enthalpy to a set point; the other is a solid state device that compares the outdoor ambient enthalpy to the return air enthalpy. This comparative enthalpy control can improve total economizer performance.

All unit controls include an internal dry bulb changeover strategy that can be selected at the keypad. When this method is selected, the controller compares the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature to a keypad programmable set point. The external enthalpy control input is then ignored.

# *Cooling and Heating Lockout Control*

All unit controls include separate keypad programmable set points for locking out mechanical cooling and heating. Mechanical cooling is locked out when the outdoor temperature is below the cooling lockout set point; heating is locked out when the outdoor temperature is above the heating lockout set point. This feature can save energy cost by eliminating unnecessary heating and cooling during warm-up or cool-down periods or when the outdoor air temperature is mild.

# *Night Setback and Setup Control*

When one of the zone temperature sensors is connected to the unit controller, night setback heating and night setup cooling control are available. Separate, keypad programmable night heating and cooling set points are used to start the unit when necessary. After the unit starts, night setback and setup control is similar to normal occupied control except that the minimum outside air damper position is set to zero. If the outside air is suitable for free cooling, it is used during night setup operation.

Except for 100% outside air applications, night setback control is available even if the unit is not equipped with any heating equipment. When the space temperature falls to the night setback set point, the fans simply start and run until the temperature rises above the differential. This feature might be useful for applications that use, for example, duct-mounted reheat coils.

# *Morning Warm-up Control*

If the Control Temperature (space or return) is below set point when the unit enters the occupied mode, the morning warm-up control function will keep the outside air dampers closed while heat is supplied to satisfy set point. The outside air damper will remain closed until either the space temperature rises to the heating set point or the keypad adjustable morning warm-up timer expires (default is 90 minutes). The morning warm-up timer supplies the minimum required amount of outdoor air after a certain time regardless of the space temperature.

Morning warm-up control is automatically included on all except 100% outside air units. It is available even if the unit is not equipped with any heating equipment, for applications that utilize, for example, duct-mounted reheat coils.

# *Proportional Integral (PI) Control*

The Proportional Integral (PI) control algorithm controls modulating actuators to maintain a measured variable (temperature or pressure) at or near its set point. For example, it controls economizer dampers to maintain the discharge cooling set point and it controls the supply fan variable frequency drives to maintain the duct static pressure set point. The integral control feature effectively eliminates "proportional droop" (load dependent offset) resulting in the tightest possible control.

For each PI loop, four keypad adjustable parameters allow the control loop to be properly tuned for any application:

- Period
- Dead band
- Proportional band
- Integral time

Appropriate default values for these parameters are loaded into each controller. These default values will provide proper control for most applications; therefore, field tuning is usually not required and thus start-up time is reduced.

# *Change Algorithm*

The PI function is also used to adjust set points instead of controlling variable speed drives or actuators directly. For example, in zone control applications, the PI loop automatically "changes" the discharge temperature set point (cooling or heating) as the Control Temperature deviates from the zone set point. Another PI loop then controls the economizer actuator or heating valve actuator using the current discharge temperature set point. Unlike a typical "master-submaster" reset strategy, this "cascade control" continuously adjusts the discharge set point, even if the Control Temperature's deviation from set point remains constant. This means that the unit's cooling or heating output is set according to the actual load, not just the current zone temperature. The tightest possible zone temperature control results because "proportional droop" (load dependent offset) is eliminated.

23------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-23-0"></span># *Calibrate*

When initiated at the keypad by an operator, the Calibrate function automatically calibrates all actuator position feedback inputs and all pressure transducer inputs. It does this by shutting the unit down and then driving all actuators to the full closed and full open positions. The controller records the input voltage values that correspond to these positions. The pressure transducer input voltages, which are assumed for 0.00-in. W.C., are also recorded. When Calibrate is finished, enter an operator command at the keypad to start the unit.

# *Field Output Signals*

All MicroTech RoofPak controls include two solid-state relay outputs that are available for field connection to any suitable device: the remote alarm output and the occupied output. These two outputs are used to signal field equipment of unit status.

# *Remote Alarm Output:*

The remote alarm output can be used to operate a 24 volt relay to provide a remote alarm signal to a light, audible alarm, or other device when an alarm condition exists at the unit.

# *Fan Operation Output:*

The fan operation output is used to operate a 24 volt relay to control field equipment that depends on fan operation; for instance, to open field installed isolation dampers or VAV boxes. To allow actuators enough time to stroke, the fan operation output is energized three minutes before the fans start. It then remains energized until thirty seconds after the unit airflow switch senses no airflow. The fan operation output is on whenever the unit airflow switch senses airflow.

# **Standard Control Options**

Model RPS. RDT, and RFS applied rooftop systems are available for most any constant or variable air volume application. MicroTech controls offer three basic control configurations: variable air volume with discharge temperature control (VAV-DTC), constant air volume with zone temperature control (CAV-ZTC), and constant air volume with discharge temperature control (CAV-DTC), that use sophisticated state change control logic to provide stable, reliable and efficient control. When combined with MicroTech's many available control capabilities, both factory installed and keypad programmable, these three basic configurations can be customized to meet the requirements of the most demanding applications.

# **Variable Air Volume with Discharge Temperature Control (VAV)**

All VAV units provide true discharge temperature control in addition to duct static pressure control. Cooling only, cooling with single-stage "morning warm-up" heat, and cooling with modulating heat configurations are available. On units with a return fan, two building static pressure control options are available: VaneTrol logic tracking or direct building pressure control. Because proper ventilation rates have been identified as critical to maintaining good indoor air quality, all RoofPak VAV controllers include software algorithms designed to maintain minimum outside air volume at all times when the unit is in the Occupied mode.

# **Constant Air Volume with Zone Temperature Control (CAV-ZTC)**

CAV-ZTC units are available in either cooling only or cooling with modulating heat configurations. Either of these configurations is available for 100% recirculated, mixed, or 100% outdoor air applications. On units that have a return fan, a direct building static pressure control option is also available.

# **Constant Air Volume with Discharge Temperature Control (CAV-DTC)**

CAV-DTC units are available in cooling only, cooling with single-stage "morning warm-up" heat, or cooling with modulating heat configurations. This unit configuration can be used for applications that have zone controlled terminal reheat coils or for constant volume, 100% outdoor air applications. The discharge temperature control strategies used with the hybrid CAV-DTC unit are identical to those used with the VAVDTC unit. On units that have a return fan, a direct building static pressure control option is available (constant supply air volume applications only).

# **Discharge Temperature Control**

MicroTech VAV-DTC and CAV-DTC controls provide sophisticated and flexible discharge air temperature control that is only possible with DDC systems. Separate discharge air temperature set points are used for cooling and modulating heating control. At the keypad, the operator can either enter the desired set points or select separate reset methods and parameters for each set point (see [on page](#page-24-0)  [25](#page-24-0)).

# **Control Temperature**

The Control Temperature makes the heat/cool changeover decision. It determines whether cooling or heating is enabled; the discharge temperature then determines whether cooling or heating is actually supplied. At the keypad, the operator can choose the source of the Control Temperature from among the following selections.

- Space temperature sensor
- Return temperature sensor
- Outside air temperature sensor (modulating heat only)
- Network communication

The operator enters separate cool and heat enable set points and deadbands that the Control Temperature is compared with (see [Figure 27](#page-24-1)). When the Control Temperature is greater than or equal to the cooling set point plus DB/2, cooling is enabled. When the Control Temperature is less than or equal to the heat set point minus DB/2, heating is enabled. If desired, these set points and differentials can be set so that there is a dead band in which both cooling and heating are disabled. The controller's software prevents simultaneous cooling and heating.

## *Figure 27: Control Temperature Logic*

<span id="page-24-1"></span># **Proportional Integral Modulation**

When operating in economizer free cooling or unit heating, the previously described PI algorithm maintains discharge temperature control. It provides precise control of the economizer dampers, modulating gas heat, steam or hot water valves.

# **Compressor Staging**

Two staging algorithms are available to control a unit's multiple steps of capacity control, Degree-Time (also known as "average") and Nearest. These control algorithms provide reliable discharge temperature control while managing compressor cycling rates. Constraints on compressor staging are essential for preventing short cycling, which can reduce compressor life by causing improper oil return and excessive heat buildup in the motor windings.

The Degree-Time Compressor staging algorithm keeps track of the discharge temperature and stages cooling up or down to maintain an average temperature that is equal to the discharge cooling set point. A stage change can occur only (1) after the keypad adjustable inter-stage timer has expired (five minute default setting) and (2) if the discharge temperature is outside a keypad programmed dead band. After these two conditions have been met, staging occurs as the controller attempts to equalize two running totals: degree-time above set point and degree-time below set point. The result is that the average discharge temperature is maintained at the cooling set point.

<span id="page-24-0"></span>The Nearest Compressor staging algorithm keeps track of the discharge temperature and stages cooling up or down to maintain the discharge temperature as close as possible to set point. A stage change can occur only (1) after the keypad adjustable inter-stage timer has expired (five minute default setting) and (2) if the control logic calculates that a stage change will result in a discharge temperature closer to set point than the existing condition. The controller logic continually calculates the expected effect of a stage change and uses this information before making a change. A change is made only if it will bring the discharge temperature closer to set point, resulting in a more consistent discharge temperature, reduced compressor cycling and more stable control VAV box control.

# **Supply Air Reset**

By automatically varying the discharge air temperature to suit a building's cooling or heating needs, supply air temperature reset can increase the energy efficiency of VAV and CAV-DTC systems. MicroTech controllers offer a variety of different reset strategies that can be selected at the keypad. Because they are keypad programmable, reset strategies can be changed or eliminated as desired. Separate strategies can be selected for both cooling and modulating heat. If reset is not desired, a fixed discharge cooling or heating set point can be entered.

The following reset methods are available:

- Space temperature
- Return temperature
- Outdoor air temperature
- Supply airflow (VAV, cooling set point only)
- External 0–10 VDC or 0–20 mA signal
- Network communication

For all temperature reset methods, the minimum and maximum cooling and heating set points are keypad programmable along with the corresponding minimum and maximum space, return or outdoor air temperature parameters. For the supply airflow method, the discharge set point will be reset as the supply fan modulates between 30% adjustable and 100% adjustable. For the external method, the discharge set point will be reset as the voltage or current signal varies over its entire range. For units in a BAS network, the discharge set points are reset via the communication signal.

# **Zone Temperature Control**

MicroTech CAV-ZTC controls provide the sophisticated and flexible zone temperature control that is only possible with DDC systems. Zone temperature sensors are available with or without a remote set point adjustment. With the remote adjustment model, the space set point can be set at the keypad or at the zone sensor package. Even if a zone sensor is connected, remote set point adjustment can be enabled or disabled as desired at the keypad.

# **Control Temperature**

The Control Temperature is the representative zone temperature. When compared with the zone set points, the Control Temperature determines whether the unit supplies heating, cooling, or neither. It also determines the amount of cooling or heating required to satisfy the load. Its source can be selected at the keypad from among the following selections:

- Zone temperature sensor
- Return temperature sensor

Because it is the representative zone temperature, the Control Temperature is the primary input to the MicroTech zone temperature control algorithms. Control Temperature parameters are described below. The controller's software will prevent cooling and heating from being inadvertently enabled at the same time.

# **Change and Proportional Integral Modulation**

When economizer "free" cooling or unit heating is required, the two MicroTech PI loops combine for cascade-type control, providing the tightest possible zone temperature control. By controlling the discharge temperature along with the zone temperature, these functions eliminate temperature variations near the diffusers that could otherwise occur as a result of traditional zone control's inherent lag effect.

**Change:** If the Control Temperature is above or below the set point by more than the dead band, the Change PI loop periodically adjusts the cooling or heating discharge air temperature set point either up or down as necessary. The amount of this set point change corresponds to the Control Temperature's position in the modulation range. The farther the Control Temperature is from the set point, the greater the discharge set point change will be. The Change-adjusted discharge cooling and heating set points are limited to ranges defined by keypad programmable maximum and minimum values.

**PI:** Using the Change function's current discharge set point, the PI function maintains precise discharge temperature control by modulating the economizer dampers and gas heat, steam or hot water heating valves.

# **Compressor Staging**

Compressor staging is controlled directly by the Control Temperature. When the Control Temperature is warmer than the zone cooling set point, cooling is staged up; when the Control Temperature is cooler than the zone cooling set point, cooling is staged down. However, a stage change can only occur when the Control Temperature is outside the dead band (see [Figure 28](#page-25-0)). Staging is constrained by an inter-stage delay timer (five minute default setting) and minimum and maximum discharge air temperature limits (all keypad programmable). These constraints protect the compressors from short cycling while eliminating temperature variations near the diffusers.

<span id="page-25-0"></span># **Project Ahead Algorithm**

Because the inherent lag effect in zone temperature control applications can cause overshoot during warm-up or cooldown periods, MicroTech features a "Project Ahead" control algorithm. Project Ahead calculates the rate at which the Control Temperature is changing and reduces the unit's cooling or heating output as the zone temperature nears its set point, essentially eliminating overshoot.

<span id="page-26-0"></span># **Duct Static Pressure Control**

On all VAV-DTC units, duct static pressure control is maintained by the PI algorithm, which provides precise control of the supply fan variable speed drive. The keypad programmable set point can be set between 0.20-in. W.C. and 4.00-in. W.C.

On larger buildings with multiple floors, multiple trunk runs or large shifts in load due to solar effects (east/west building orientation), an optional second duct static sensor is offered. The MicroTech controller automatically selects and uses the lower of the two sensed pressures to control fan volume to provide adequate static pressure to the most demanding space at all times.

# **Building Static Pressure Control**

A key element in successful VAV application is the ability to track supply and return air fan volumes so that proper building static pressure is maintained. Daikin Applied, a pioneer in the development of rooftop VAV systems, developed its exclusive VaneTrol™ fan tracking control logic to solve this issue. Incorporating over 30 years of rooftop VAV system experience, the latest generation MicroTech controls with VaneTrol logic provide advanced and accurate duct static pressure control plus supply and return fan tracking control that effectively and efficiently manages building static pressure.

# **VaneTrol™ Fan Tracking Control (does not apply to exhaust fans)**

VaneTrol fan tracking control logic offers close and reliable building static pressure control for VAV units equipped with a return air fan. With the VaneTrol logic method, the return fan's variable speed drive assembly tracks the supply fan volume as the supply fan maintains the required duct static pressure using the additional parameter of maintaining a field programmable offset between supply fan and return fan volume. The result is that building pressure is maintained, regardless of the building cooling load, because the proper relationship between supply and return fan volume is maintained. Because the return fan/ supply fan tracking relationship is established once during controlled test-and-balance conditions, ongoing building pressure control is not affected by a fluctuating ambient pressure reference signal or the temporary effects of opening and closing doors on a pressure sensor in the lobby.

VaneTrol control logic uses four keypad programmable parameters to maintain the required relationship between return fan and supply fan volumes. These are the supply and corresponding return fan volumes as measured by variable speed drive position, at both maximum and minimum airflow conditions.

[Table 3](#page-26-1) shows an example of how supply and return air fan modulation must vary to maintain the correct balance of supply and return air volumes based on the building's parameters and therefore maintain building pressure. Determining the building's correct VaneTrol parameters is easy with MicroTech's Balance feature. With Balance, start-up time is reduced because final adjustments are made at the keypad.

#### <span id="page-26-1"></span>*Table 3: VaneTrol Logic Air Balancing*


# **Direct Space Pressure Control (for return or exhaust fans)**

Any constant or variable air volume unit equipped with a variable volume return or exhaust fan can be provided with direct building static pressure control capability. With the direct method, building static pressure is measured and processed by the PI algorithm. This algorithm provides precise control of the return fan variable speed drive or inlet vanes to maintain the space pressure set point. The range of the keypad programmable set point is between minus 0.25-in. W.C. and 0.25-in. W.C.

This type of control can be used for either whole building or lab pressurization (positive or negative) applications, or exhaust fan control where VaneTrol control logic does not apply.

# **Minimum Ventilation Air Volume Control**

Consistently maintaining the minimum outdoor air requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 has been a long standing control challenge for VAV systems. As supply air fan volumes were reduced, the volume of air introduced through a fixed position, minimum outdoor air damper was also reduced, compromising indoor air quality. To meet this challenge, MicroTech controls feature four user-selected control methods for maintaining outdoor air volume.

- The MicroTech controller can accept a signal from a DesignFlow Precision Ventilation Air Control System, which is continuously measuring outdoor air volume, and adjust outdoor air damper position to maintain the minimum volume set point.
- MicroTech controls have a keypad selected control function that automatically adjusts outdoor air damper position in response to changes in supply air fan volume. Regardless of supply air volume, this strategy maintains a nearly constant outdoor air volume at all times.The MicroTech controller can accept an external 0–10 VDC signal from a CO2 sensor or other control device and adjust outdoor air damper position.
- If desired, a fixed minimum damper position can be keypad programmed. This selection may be acceptable when ventilation requirements are met through other sources.

During cold ambient conditions where outdoor/return mixed air conditions can become too low, MicroTech controls maintain the cooling discharge temperature set point by controlling the unit heating system. For applications where ambient temperatures and minimum outdoor air requirements can generate this condition, order the RoofPak unit with modulating heating equipment, such as the SuperMod gas burner.

It assumes a VAV unit with a 20% outdoor air requirement at design conditions and a 40% minimum airflow requirement.

## <span id="page-27-1"></span>*Table 4: Effect of Minimum Ventilation Control on Discharge Temperature*


# **Multiple Air Handler Control**

For applications in which multiple units are connected in a common duct system, it is important to control all units from a common duct static pressure sensor and to control all operating units in unison. Centralized duct static pressure control can be accomplished through communication with the BAS network.

# **Operating States**

Operating states define the current overall status of the rooftop system. At the user interface, the operator can display the current operating state and thereby quickly assess the unit's operating condition. [Figure 29](#page-27-2) shows all possible operating states and the status information they summarize. Depending on unit options, some operating states may not apply. For example, a 100% outside air unit does not have a Morning Warm-Up, Economizer or Unoccupied Economizer operating state. Below are descriptions of each operating state.

# **Alarm Management and Control**

MicroTech unit controllers are capable of sophisticated alarm management and controlled response functions. Each alarm is prioritized, indicated, and responded to with the appropriate action. The active alarm (up to 10 alarms, arranged by alarm priority) and previous alarm (up to 25 alarms, arrange by date/time cleared), each with a time and date stamp, can be displayed at the user interface. Generally speaking, whenever a current alarm is cleared, it is logged as a previous alarm and the oldest previous alarm is removed.

# **Alarm Priority**

The various alarms that can occur are prioritized according to the severity of the problem. Three alarm categories are used: faults, problems, and warnings.

- 1. Faults are the highest priority alarms. If a fault condition occurs, the complete unit is shut down until the alarm condition is gone and the fault is manually cleared at the keypad. A fault example is Fan Fail alarm.
- 2. Problems are the next lower priority to faults. If a problem occurs, the complete unit does not shut down, but its operation is modified to compensate for the alarm condition. A problem automatically clears when the alarm condition that caused it is gone. Compressor Fail is an example of a problem where only the affected compressor is shut down.
- 3. Warnings are the lowest priority alarms. No control action is taken when a warning occurs; it is simply indicated to alert the operator that the alarm condition needs attention. To remind the operator to read warnings, they must be manually cleared. Dirty Filter indication is an example of a warning.

Generally, a specific alarm condition generates an alarm that falls into only one of these categories. Under different sets of circumstances, however, the freezestat and most of the sensor failure alarm conditions can generate alarms that fall into multiple categories.

# **Adjustable Alarm Limits**

Four alarm triggers have adjustable limits. The high return temperature alarm and the high and low supply temperature alarms are adjusted at the user interface. The dirty filter alarm(s) is adjusted at the sensing device.

# <span id="page-29-1"></span><span id="page-29-0"></span>**Application Considerations**

The following section contains basic application and installation guidelines that must be considered as part of the detailed analysis of any specific project.

# **General**

Units are intended for use in normal heating, ventilating and air conditioning applications. Consult your local Daikin Applied sales representative for applications involving operation at high ambient temperatures, high altitudes, non-cataloged voltages and for applications requiring modified or special control sequences. Consult your local Daikin Applied sales representative for job specific unit selections that fall outside of the range of the catalog tables, such as 100% outside air applications.

For proper operation, units should be rigged in accordance with instructions stated in [IM 485](http://www.DaikinApplied.com). Fire dampers, if required, must be installed in the ductwork according to local or state codes. No space is allowed for these dampers in the unit.

Follow factory check, test and start procedures explicitly to achieve satisfactory start-up and operation (see [IM 485\)](http://www.DaikinApplied.com).

Most rooftop applications take advantage of the significant energy savings provided with economizer operation. When an economizer system is used, mechanical refrigeration is typically not required below an ambient temperature of 50°F. Standard RoofPak refrigeration systems are designed to operate in ambient temperatures down to 45°F. For applications where an economizer system cannot be used, Daikin Applied's VFD, condenser fan, head pressure control system is available for operations down to 0°F. However, if the condenser coils are not properly shielded from the wind, the minimum ambient conditions stated above must be raised.

# **Unit Location**

The structural engineer must verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Take extreme caution when using a wooden roof structure.

Locate the unit fresh air intakes away from building flue stacks or exhaust ventilators to reduce possible reintroduction of contaminated air to the system. Unit condenser coils should be located to avoid contact with any heated exhaust air.

Allow sufficient space around the unit for maintenance/ service clearance as well as to allow for full outside air intake, removal of exhaust air and for full condenser airflow. Refer to [Application Considerations on page 30](#page-29-1) for recommended clearances. Consult your Daikin Applied sales representative if available clearances do not meet minimum recommendations. Where code considerations, such as the NEC, require extended clearances, they take precedence.

In applications utilizing a future cooling unit (RFS), take care in choosing a location of the unit so it provides proper roof support and service and ventilation clearance necessary for the later addition of a mechanical cooling section (RCS).

# **Split Units**

Units may sometimes have to be split into multiple pieces to accommodate shipping limitations or jobsite lifting limitations. Units exceeding 52 feet in length may need to be split for shipping purposes. Units exceeding the rating of an available crane or helicopter may also need to be split for rigging purposes. Unit can be split between the supply fan and heat section. Contact your local Daikin Applied sales representative for more details.

# **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16 in. per foot side to side). A sub-base has to be constructed by the contractor in applications involving pitched roofs. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. Typical curb installation is illustrated in [Roof Curbs](#page-72-1)  [Dimensions on page 73.](#page-72-1) In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side.

Applications in geographic areas that are subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

For acoustical considerations, the condensing section is provided with a support rail versus a full perimeter roof curb. When curbs are installed on a built-up roof with metal decking, an inverted 6-in. channel should be provided on both sides of the unit. Acoustical material should be installed over the decking, inside the roof curb. Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking. Apply appropriate acoustical and vibration design practices during the early stages of design to provide noise compatibility with the intended use of the space. Consult your Daikin Applied sales representative for unit sound power data.

<span id="page-30-0"></span># **Acoustics**

Good acoustical design is a critical part of any installation and should start at the earliest stages in the design process. Each of the four common sound paths for rooftop equipment must be addressed. These are:

- Radiated sound through the bottom of the unit (air handling section and condensing section) and into the space. Structure-borne vibration from the unit to the building
- Airborne sound through the supply air duct
- Airborne sound through the return air duct

Locating rooftop equipment away from sound sensitive areas is critical and the most cost effective means of avoiding sound problems. If possible, rooftop equipment should always be located over less sensitive areas such as corridors, toilet facilities or auxiliary spaces and away from office areas, conference rooms and classrooms. If the air handler must be located above or near a sensitive area, then consider an RFS/ RCS split system and move the RCS to a less sensitive area.

Some basic guidelines for good acoustical performance are:

- Use the Quiet Condenser option when radiating noise is a concern
- Always provide proper structural support under all areas of the unit
- Always locate the unit's center of gravity close to a main support to minimize roof deflection. Maintaining a roof deflection under 1/3 in. minimizes vibration-induced noise
- Use a concrete deck or pad when a unit has to be located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential
- Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking within the curb perimeter, and the openings must be sealed once the duct is installed
- Don't overlook the return air path. Never leave a clear "line of sight" into a return or exhaust fan; always include some duct work (acoustically lined tee) at the return inlet
- Place an acoustical material in the area directly beneath the condensing section
- Select acoustical material that does not encourage microbial growth
- Minimize system static pressure losses to reduce fan sound generation
- Select the appropriate fan for the application. Fans should be selected as close as possible to their peak static efficiency. To assist you, peak static efficiency is identified by the first system curve to the right of the shaded "Do not select" region, as illustrated in [Figure 30](#page-30-1)
- Design duct systems to minimize turbulence
- Account for low frequency duct breakout in system design. Route the first 20 ft. of rectangular duct over non-sensitive areas and avoid large duct aspect ratios. Consider round or oval duct to reduce breakout
- When an added measure of airborne fan sound control is required, sound attenuators can be supplied, factory installed in a unit discharge air section, to treat the supply fan. On the return side, additional attenuation can often be achieved by routing the return duct within the curb area beneath the unit

There are many sound sources in rooftop systems. Fans, compressors, condenser fans, duct take-offs, etc. all generate sound. For guidelines on reducing sound generation in the duct system, refer to the [2003 ASHRAE Applications Handbook,](https://ashrae.org/)  [Chapter 47.](https://ashrae.org/)

# <span id="page-31-1"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>**Economizer, Return Fan and Exhaust Fan Application**

Rooftop economizer applications usually require return or exhaust fans to properly control building pressure and minimum ventilation. Daikin Applied offers both exhaust and return fan capability. They are not generally interchangeable for a given design and perform differently. In general:

- Return air fans (RAF) are best suited for ducted return systems (return ESP exceeds 0.4" to 0.5").
- Exhaust air fans (EAF) are best suited for open return systems (return ESP is less than 0.4" to 0.5").
- Supply air fan (SAF) selection depends on whether a return or exhaust fan is used.
	- RAF system-SAF handles only the supply ESP at design.
	- EAF system-SAF handles both the supply and return ESP at design (EAF is off).

[Figure 31](#page-31-2) illustrates why SAF only units often cannot control building pressure and ventilation, especially as return ESP increases.

- Desired space pressure is approximately 0.1" as shown
- No exhaust will occur from the rooftop because the economizer section must be at a negative pressure. Therefore, space pressure rises until exhaust occurs through doors and walls
- The air balancer must adjust the outdoor air damper to be "almost shut" and generate large pressure drops at minimum ventilation settings (about 0.9" in [Figure](#page-31-2)  [31\)](#page-31-2). Otherwise excess outdoor air would be pulled in. Ventilation control is much less accurate at the "almost shut" damper position, especially on VAV systems where minimum position varies with load

### <span id="page-31-2"></span>*Figure 31: Supply Air Fan Only System Static Pressures with 1*" *Return Duct ESP*

 -
 
- 

[Figure 32](#page-31-3) illustrates how the addition of a RAF corrects these problems. The RAF is responsible for return system ESP and maintains a slightly positive pressure in the economizer section (about +0.1" in [Figure 32\)](#page-31-3) to allow for proper exhaust and better ventilation control.

#### <span id="page-31-3"></span>*Figure 32: RAF System Allows Proper Exhaust and Outdoor Air Control*

### EAFs are very different from RAFs.

- EAFs provide less effective building pressure and ventilation control as return duct ESP increases.The EAF is normally off during non-economizer operation. During these minimum outdoor air conditions, the system essentially acts like a SAF only system
- EAFs cannot maintain a slightly positive pressure in the economizer section, so ventilation control is no better than that of an SAF only system
- EAFs can successfully operate and save energy on designs with reduced return ESP for the following reasons
	- EAFs and RAFs are generally much less efficient than SAFs. EAFs can sometimes be cycled off while RAFs must always run. If a non-overloading, airfoil SAF is used then energy generally is saved when the EAF is cycled OFF
	- Exhaust fans are designed for peak exhaust CFM which occurs during economizer operation. RAFs must be sized for design return CFM. Peak exhaust CFM generally is less than the design return CFM

# **Fan Isolation**

All Daikin Applied RoofPak systems feature internally isolated fans. All supply and return air fans are statically and dynamically balanced in the factory and mounted on rubber-in-shear (RIS) or 2-in. deflection spring isolators. Flexible isolation is provided as standard between the fan outlet and the discharge bulkhead to prevent hard contact and vibration transmission. Spring isolated fan assemblies also are available with seismic restraints.

The choice of 2-in. deflection spring isolation or RIS isolation depends on an analysis of the roof structure and whether or not an isolation curb is being provided. When using an isolation curb, consult with the curb manufacturer before selecting spring isolation in the rooftop unit. Doubling or "stacking" spring isolation can generate a resonant vibration.

# <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Indoor Fan and Motor Heat, Blow-Through vs Draw-Through Cooling**

Daikin Applied offers blow-through and draw-through cooling coils so the unit can be best selected to match job requirements.

# **Indoor Fan and Motor Heat**

- The indoor fan and motor electrical consumption is a sensible cooling load approximately equal to 2.8 MBh per BHP (depending slightly on motor efficiency). This occurs at the fan. See [Figure 33](#page-32-1) and [Figure 34.](#page-32-2) The fan and motor preheat the mixed air before it enters a blowthrough cooling coil. The fan and motor reheat the air leaving a draw-through cooling coil. Refer also to [2001](https://ashrae.org/)  [ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook, Chapter 31](https://ashrae.org/)
- Fan and motor temperature rise is equal to Btuh/(1.08 × cfm) and is typically about 3°F
- Due to fan and motor heat placement ([Figure 33\)](#page-32-1), blowthrough coils provide a high sensible heat ratio while draw-through coils provide more latent cooling per total ton. Blow-through coils achieve a higher sensible heat ratio because they operate with a higher coil approach temperature and a lower entering relative humidity. Conversely, draw-through coils cool air at a lower approach temperature and a higher relative humidity, increasing latent cooling
- Blow-through coils effectively provide colder supply air temperatures per ton of air conditioning and greater sensible heat ratio. This potentially allows a significant reduction in design cfm for buildings with high sensible heat ratios and a resulting reduction in building energy use

<span id="page-32-1"></span># **Blow-through Cooling Design**

Fan and motor heat before coil

<span id="page-32-2"></span>*Figure 34: Blow-Through vs. Draw-Through Performance* 

# **Draw-Through**

**(available on all units)** 

In a draw-through unit, the fan is located after the DX cooling coil. In this arrangement, fan heat is applied as reheat to the cold, conditioned air coming off of the coil. This arrangement has a lower sensible heat ratio and higher dehumidification capability than a blow-through coil arrangement. Draw-through arrangements are well suited for 100% outside air applications and applications needing more dehumidification. A drawthrough arrangement is mandatory for all applications requiring final filters. The discharge temperature available to the supply duct is always the sum of the coil leaving air temperature plus the fan temperature rise. This must be considered when selecting the supply air volume required to satisfy space requirements.

# *Example:*

55°F leaving coil temperature + 3°F fan temp. rise = 58°F discharge air temperature

# **Blow-Through**

In a blow-through unit, the fan is located before the DX cooling coil. In this arrangement, fan heat is applied as preheat to the coil. Preheating the air lowers its relative humidity, giving this arrangement a high sensible heat ratio. Blowthrough arrangements are well suited for comfort conditioning applications where space heat gains are primarily sensible and the primary latent load is from ventilation air. The discharge temperature available to the supply duct is the coil leaving air temperature.

<span id="page-33-0"></span># <span id="page-33-3"></span>**Altitude Adjustments**

Fan curve performance is based on 70°F air temperature and sea level elevation. Selections at any other conditions require the following adjustment for air densities listed in [Table 6](#page-33-1). Higher elevations generally require more rpm to provide a given static pressure but less bhp due to the decrease in air density.

- 1. Assume 32,000 cfm is required at 3.11" TSP. The elevation is 5000 ft. and 70°F average air temperature is selected. A 40" DWDI airfoil fan is selected.
- 2. Density adjustment factor for 5000 ft. and 70°F is 0.83.
- 3. TSP must be adjusted as follows: 3.11" / 0.83 = 3.75".
- 4. Locate 32,000 cfm and 3.75 on the fan curve ([Figure 35](#page-33-2)). Rpm = 900 and bhp = 27.5. The required fan speed is 900 rpm.
- <span id="page-33-1"></span>5. The consumed fan power at design = 27.5 bph × 0.83 = 22.8 bhp.


*Table 6: Temperature and Altitude Conversion Factors* 

# **Condenser Performance**

Altitudes greater than sea level require a derate in condenser and cooling performance that can be estimated as follows:

- 0 to 6000 feet
	- Cooling capacity decrease factor = 0.5% per 1000 feet
	- Compressor kW increase factor = 0.6% per 1000 feet

The actual derate varies with each individual unit and design conditions. Your local Daikin Applied representative can provide exact performance data.

# **Furnace Performance**

- Gas heat performance data is based on standard 70°F combustion air temperature and zero feet altitude (sea level)
- Furnace altitude derate may be 4% per 1000' above 2000' due to lesser combustion air density
- However, if design ambient is cold enough, then the combined affect of colder temperature and altitude may have an offsetting impact on combustion air density

# *Example:*

A 1000 MBh furnace at 70°F ambient and at an altitude of 5000 feet is derated (0.04 × 3 = 0.12). At 1000 MBh input (1000 × 0.12 MBh), the actual input is (1000 – 120 = 880 MBh) at 5000 feet.

# **System Operating Limits**

Daikin Applied RoofPak systems are designed to operate over an extensive operating range. However, for proper system operation some limits do apply.

To help prevent moisture blow-off, design guidelines have been established for cooling coil selection.

Based on laboratory testing, average coil face velocities should not exceed the following limits:

- 650 ft./min. for 8 & 10 fpi selections
- 600 ft./min. for 12 fpi selections
- For applications outside of these limits, consult your Daikin Applied sales representative. Velocities exceeding these limits not only present the potential for moisture carryover, but also high face velocities generate high air pressure drops, resulting in poor fan energy performance

In addition to maximum face velocity limitations, minimum velocity guidelines must also be followed. In order to maintain proper refrigeration performance, the minimum coil face velocity is 200 ft./min., regardless of coil fin spacing. When selecting a variable air volume unit, it is necessary to design the system such that the 200 ft./min. limit is maintained at light load conditions.

# **Coil Freeze Protection**

When applying roof-mounted equipment in areas that experience subfreezing conditions, coil freeze protection 

34------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-34-0"></span>measures must be provided. Subfreezing temperatures can adversely affect water and steam coils during controlled or uncontrolled unit shutdowns and even during unit operation. Daikin Applied RoofPak economizer dampers are arranged to direct the outside and return air streams in multiple mixing patterns, minimizing air stratification. Even though this is one of the most effective mixing arrangements available, there may not always be a uniform unit temperature profile under all load and ambient temperatures. Some temperature stratification will occur, particularly at low ambient temperatures and the associated reduced airflow inherent with VAV systems. When required, static air mixers/blenders are available that can significantly improve mixing and reduce stratification. This can result in improved protection against freeze-up.

Glycol is strongly recommended as a positive means of freeze protection for water coils. No control sequence can prevent coil freezing in the event of a power failure or equipment malfunction. During those periods, glycol is the only positive means of freeze protection. When selecting water coils, specify glycol to account for performance differences.

An optional non-averaging freezestat equipment protection control can be provided, located downstream of the heating coil. If a potential freezing condition is sensed, a sequence is initiated by the unit control system, closing outdoor air dampers, opening the heating valve and deenergizing the fan. The freezestat setting should be some increment higher than freezing to provide an added margin of protection. The use of a freezestat control may cause nuisance trips. It cannot prevent freeze-up in the event of power failure or equipment malfunction.

Freeze protection control strategies must be designed to keep unit cabinet temperatures from exceeding 150°F during a unit shutdown. Temperatures in excess of 150°F may exceed the design limits of motors, electrical components, gaskets, etc. potentially leading to premature failure of components.

# **Piping and Condensate Drainage**

Always follow good industry practice in the design of the water piping system. Do not apply undue stress at the connection to coil headers. In addition, support piping independently from the coils with adequate piping flexibility for thermal expansion.

Provide all drain pans with a properly sized p-trap to allow free drainage of coil condensate. Provide traps to prevent cabinet static pressure from leaking air at the drain line in blowthrough coil applications. For draw-through coil applications, a properly sized and installed trap is essential to allow for proper condensate drainage. An improper trap could cause condensate to build up in the drain pan and overflow into the unit. For trap sizing, follow instruction given in [IM 485.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com) Run all traps and drain lines full size from the threaded unit connection to the roof drain.

Units providing steam heat must be installed level to provide proper drainage and adequate steam pressure at the steam valve and coil. Condensate must be properly trapped with vacuum breakers installed on the coil (See [Figure 36\)](#page-34-1). For steam piping recommendations, see Daikin Applied [Steam](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)  [Coil Catalog 413.](http://www.DaikinApplied.com)

# **Zone Sensor Placement**

Placement of the zone temperature sensor is critical for proper and economical operation of the heating and cooling system. It is generally recommended that the space sensor be located on an inside wall (3 to 5 feet from an outside wall) in a space having a floor area of at least 400 square feet. Do not locate the sensor below the outlet of a supply diffuser, in the direct rays of the sun, on a wall adjacent to an unheated or abnormally warm room (boiler or incinerator room), or near any heat producing equipment. Where zone sensor placement is a problem, all zone control systems, as standard, have the capability to use a return air sensor for heating and cooling.

# **Unit Wiring**

All units require three phase, 60 Hz, 208, 230, 460 or 575 volt power or three phase, 50 Hz, 400 volt power. Units do not operate satisfactorily at ±10% of rated voltage, at the power connections to the units. All units include branch circuit, short circuit protection and are available with one or multiple power blocks or non-fused disconnect switches. Each unit is provided with a 115-volt convenience outlet circuit. Per the NEC, this circuit must be fed independent of the main unit power supply.

All wiring must be installed in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) and local codes.

# **Condenser Coil Protection**

If the Rooftop is installed in a corrosive environment, such as near a sea coast, Daikin Applied recommends the optional e-coated condenser coils. Copper fin or e-coated DX coil options should also be considered.

# **Winter Shipment**

Flat bed shipment in winter can expose units to harsh road chemicals. Since equipment size and configuration precludes covering during transit, wash units free of these chemicals as soon as possible to help prevent corrosion.

<span id="page-35-0"></span># **Unit Selection**

Achieving the optimal performance of a rooftop system requires both accurate system design and proper equipment selection. Factors that control the unit selection include applicable codes, ventilation and air filtration requirements, heating and cooling loads, acceptable temperature differentials, and installation limitations. Daikin Applied RoofPak units offer a wide selection of component options providing the capability to meet diverse application requirements.

The Daikin Applied SelectTools™ software selection program allows your local Daikin Applied sales representative to provide you with fast, accurate and complete selection of Daikin Applied RoofPak units. You also can select your unit through reference to physical, performance, dimensional, and unit weight data included in this catalog. Due to the variety of cooling coil options available, only a sample of cooling capacity data is presented in the catalog.

To properly select unit equipment:

- 1. Select unit size and cooling coil.
- 2. Select heating coils and equipment.
- 3. Select fans and motors.

Below are examples that illustrate the equations and catalog references used in the unit selection process.

# *Selection Example*

A constant volume system with DX cooling and natural gas heat is required to meet the following criteria:


#### **Summer design:**


#### **Winter design:**

Return air temperature = 70°F Ambient temperature = 10°F Space heating load = 450,000 Btu/hr

# **Selecting Unit Size to Satisfy Summer Design**

Unit size is based on coil face area and cooling capacity requirements. Supply air capacity and maximum face velocity constraints should serve as a guide for selecting coil dimensions and cabinet size. Many model sizes are available with a standard and a high airflow coil selection. This flexibility prevents the need to increase cabinet size to accommodate high airflow per ton applications.

Based on the given data, the appropriate coil face area may be determined as follows:

> Minimum face area = supply air volume/maximum face velocity = 22,000 cfm/550 fpm

- = 39.3 square feet
- **NOTE:** Unit data is based on standard air conditions of 70°F at sea level. Refer to [Application Considerations on](#page-29-1)  [page 30](#page-29-1) for temperature/altitude conversion factors for nonstandard conditions.

Referring to [Physical Data on page 39](#page-38-1), the 39.5 square foot, small face area coil of the RPS 045D to 075D units satisfies the required face velocity.

The unit selection is an RPS 070D with a small face area, 5-row, 10 fins/inch DX coil. Unit performance equals 792,000 Btu/hr. total, 626,000 Btu/hr. sensible by interpolation.

Supply air dry bulb = 83°F – 626 MBh/(1.085 × 22,000 cfm) = 53.2°F

Once the initial unit selection is made, determine the actual supply fan heat rise and check and verify the selection for net capacity and supply air temperature.

# **Selecting the Unit Heating System**

Heating equipment and coils can be specified directly from figures and tables incorporated in [Heating Capacity Data on](#page-41-1)  [page 42.](#page-41-1)

## *Calculating Total Heating Load*

Total heating load = space heating load + outdoor air load – supply fan heat

From the data given, the outdoor air load is (1.085) (4000) (70 – 10) / 1000 = 260 MBh and supply fan heat is 65 MBh. Total heat load = 450 MBh + 260 MBh – 65 MBh = 645 MBh

36------------------------------------------------



**Gas Heat:** When selecting a gas furnace, the system heating load, minimum airflow and maximum temperature rise constraints are needed. Refer to [Figure 37 on page 42](#page-41-2) for furnace model size selection. Enter the graph at 20,000 cfm and move up vertically to the intersection of 602 MBh output. In this example, the intersection of Minimum cfm and MBh Output occurs between model lines. Therefore, the larger model size, Model 640, should be selected for adequate heating.

For all heat exchangers, there exists a maximum temperature rise. This limitation is determined by the heat exchanger surface area to airflow ratio. Refer to [Table 10 on page](#page-41-3)  [42](#page-41-3) for verification of the temperature rise capability of the furnace selected. Also, use this table when specifying baffle position based on minimum airflow design. Refer to [Altitude](#page-33-3)  [Adjustments on page 34](#page-33-3).

**NOTE:** In VAV applications, consider range of airflow modulation when selecting furnace model and baffle position.

**Electric Heat:** Referring to the [Electric Heat on page 14](#page-13-1) for the RPS 070D, the design load of 645 Mbh falls between heater models 200 and 240. The Model 240 heater would be chosen to satisfy the design conditions.

# **Selecting Fans and Motors**

Fan and motor selections are based on total static pressure drop and design airflow. Total static pressure includes internal air pressure drops of unit components and external air pressure drops in supply and return ducts. Refer to [Component Pressure Drops on page 48](#page-47-1) for internal pressure drops of unit components.

When selecting unit fans and motors, use the fan curves provided in [Fan Performance Data—Supply Fans on page](#page-50-1)  [51](#page-50-1) and [Fan Performance Data—Propeller Exhaust Fans on](#page-56-1)  [page 57](#page-56-1)

Careful consideration is needed in regards to return duct ESP:

- RAF system The RAF handles return ESP at design.
- EAF system The SAF handles return ESP at design.

See [page 32](#page-31-1) for details.

To optimize fan performance, select the fan size having design airflow and static pressure intersecting as close to the first system curve as possible after the shaded Do Not Select region. Refer to [Application Considerations on page 30](#page-29-1).

Select the motor size as close below the horsepower curve as possible to the actual bhp requirements to prevent motor oversizing. An oversized motor (large horsepower to load ratio) can greatly increase electric consumption due to the reduction in motor performance.

# **Return Fan and Motor**

Select an economizer with a return fan for the given system. A return (or exhaust fan) system is often necessary for maintaining proper pressure in a building. See [Application](#page-29-1)  [Considerations on page 30](#page-29-1) for more information on the economizer and return fan application.

Use the external air pressure drop of the return duct along with the design return airflow to select a return fan. Based on [Figure](#page-58-1)  [63 on page 59,](#page-58-1) the return fan size is 40 inches and the bhp = 6.5. The required fan motor size is 7.5 hp.

# **Exhaust Fan and Motor**

Exhaust fans must be sized for maximum exhaust cfm and return duct ESP at those conditions. See [Fan Performance](#page-56-1)  [Data—Propeller Exhaust Fans on page 57](#page-56-1) for more information.

# **Supply Fan and Motor**

Since this system includes a return fan, the return duct static pressure drop is not added to the supply fan pressure drop. Therefore, the total static pressure for the supply fan in the example is as follows:

Internal pressure drops (from [Table 19 on page 48\)](#page-47-2):

0–100% economizer, with RAF = 0.38-in. w.g. 30% angular filters = 0.16-in. w.g. Gas furnace = 0.24-in. w.g. Evaporative coil (small 5-row, 10 fpi) = 0.79-in. w.g. **Total internal pressure drop = 1 57-in w g** 

# *External pressure drops:*

```
Supply duct = 2.60-in. w.g. 
Total external pressure drop = 2 60-in w g 
        Total static pressure = internal drops + external drops 
                              = 1.57 + 2.60 
                              = 4.17-in. w.g.
```
**NOTE:** When gas or electric heat is provided, do not add the cooling coil diffuser pressure drop. In VAV applications with gas heat, consult your Daikin Applied sales representative for design pressure drop determinations.

For a constant volume system a forward curve or airfoil type fan can be selected. Reference [Application Considerations](#page-29-1)  [on page 30](#page-29-1) for discussion on acoustical consideration. Considering its favorable brake horsepower, an airfoil type fan is selected.

Entering the standard 30-in. airfoil fan curve (see [Figure 51 on](#page-51-0)  [page 52\)](#page-51-0) at 20,000 cfm and 4.08-in. w.g., the required fan motor size is 25 hp. Fan brake horsepower is 21.2 horsepower.

The total fan and motor heat for the supply and return fan is as follows:

(6.5 + 21.2) bhp × 2.8 MBh/bhp = 78 MBh

37------------------------------------------------



# **Supply Power Wiring for Units without Electric Heat**

Sizing supply power wire for a unit is based on the circuit with the largest amperage draw. All electrical equipment is wired to a central panel for single or optional multipower connections. Refer to [Electrical Data on page 80](#page-79-1) for FLA and RLA ratings of equipment. Determination of Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) for a 460-volt unit with standard condenser fans is as follows:

## *Fans and Cooling:*

MCA = 1.25 × RLA or FLA of largest motor + 1.00 × FLA of other loads

#### **Example FLA/RLA**

```
Compressors (6) = 17.9 amps ea.
```

```
Condenser fan motors, (6) 1 hp = 2 amps ea. 
       Supply fan motor, 25 hp = 31 amps 
      Return fan motor, 7.5 hp = 10.8 amps
```
#### **Therefore,**

MCA = 1.25 × 17.9 + [(17.9) (5) + (6)2 + 31 + 10.8] = 165.7 amps

Select power supply wire based on 165.7 amperes.

# **Supply Power Wiring for Units with Electric Heat**

When selecting units with nonconcurring electric heat, MCA must be calculated for both the cooling mode and the heating mode, and then the greater of the two used.

## *For heating:*

MCA = 1.25 [FLA of electric heater + FLA of all other loads] = 1.25 × [287.2 + 31 + 10.8]

= 409 amps

## *For cooling:*

MCA = 165.7 amps

The controlling load is when in the electric heat mode. Unit MCA = 409 amps.

# **Calculating Unit Length**

Referring to unit [Dimensional Data on page 60](#page-59-1) for a blowthrough RPS 061D, [Figure 65 on page 60](#page-59-2):

```
Total unit length = economizer w/RAF + angular filter fan section + 
                     heat section + DX coil section + discharge plenum + condensing unit 
                   = 72 in. + 24 in. + 72 in. + 48 in. + 24 in. + 48 in. + 83 in.
```
= 371 inches.

**NOTE:** When selecting unit curb length, do not include the length of the condensing unit.

# **Calculating Unit Weight**

Referring to unit [Unit Weights on page 85](#page-84-1) for a RPS 070D:

- Total unit weight = RPS basic unit + economizer + 30% filters + 30" AF SAF + 40" AF RAF + 5-row, 12 fpi Al. fin small face area coil + 640 MBh gas furnace + SAF motor + RAF motor + cabinet liners
	- = 7580 + 1065 + 4 + 965 + 629 + 600 + 428 + 266 + 82 + (25 × 288/12)
	- = 12,215 lbs.

#### <span id="page-47-2"></span>*Table 19: RFS and RDT 045D to 079D*


a. Pressure drop through hood and damper is based on 30% of listed airflow.

b. Pressure drop through the economizer assumes that the majority of air is passing through the return air dampers. If large quantities of outside air are required,

 pressure drops increase, causing airflow to decrease. c. Pressure drop of cooling coils not shown can be found in the Daikin Applied Selection Program output.

d. DX coil pressure drops are based on wet coils.

e. A cooling diffuser is provided on units with blow-through cooling only.

#### *Table 20: RPS, RFS, RDT 080D to 140D*


a. Pressure drop through hood and damper is based on 30% of listed airflow.

b. Pressure drop through the economizer assumes that the majority of air is passing through the return air dampers. If large quantities of outside air are required,

 pressure drops increase, causing airflow to decrease. c. Pressure drop of cooling coils not shown can be found in the Daikin Applied Selection Program output.

d. DX coil pressure drops are based on wet coils.

.

e. A cooling diffuser is provided on units with blow-through cooling only

# <span id="page-78-0"></span>**Recommended Clearances**

# **Service Clearance**

Allow recommended service clearances shown in [Figure 96](#page-78-1). Provide a roof walkway along two sides of the unit for service and access to most controls.

## <span id="page-78-1"></span>*Figure 96: Service Clearances*

# **Cooling Coil, Heat and Supply Fan Service Clearance**

Additional clearance, A, is recommended adjacent to the cooling coil, heat, and supply fan sections. See [Figure 65 on](#page-59-2)  [page 60](#page-59-2) through [Figure 70 on page 65](#page-64-0) to identify these sections.

## <span id="page-78-2"></span>*Table 27: Service Clearance*


## *Figure 97: Ventilation Clearances*

# **Overhead Clearance**

- 1. Unit(s) surrounded by screens or solid walls must have no overhead obstructions over any part of the unit.
- 2. Area above condenser must be unobstructed in all installations to allow vertical air discharge.
- 3. For overhead obstructions above the air handler section, observe the following restrictions:
	- a. No overhead obstructions above the furnace flue, or within 9 in. of the flue box.
	- b. Any overhead obstruction not within 2 in. of the top of the unit.
	- c. Service canopy not to protrude more than 24 in. beyond the unit in the area of the outside air and exhaust dampers.

# **Ventilation Clearance**

# *Unit(s) surrounded by a screen or a fence:*

- 1. The bottom of the screen should be a minimum of 1 ft. above the roof surface.
- 2. Minimum distance, unit to screen—same as service clearance ([Table 27\)](#page-78-2).
- 3. Minimum distance, unit to unit—120 in.

# *Unit(s) surrounded by solid walls:*

- 1. Minimum distance, unit to wall—96 in., all sizes.
- 2. Minimum distance, unit to unit—120 in.
- 3. Wall height restrictions:
	- a. Wall on one side only or on two adjacent side—no restrictions.
	- b. Walls on more than two adjacent sides—wall height not to exceed unit height.

Do not locate outside air intakes near exhaust vents or other sources of contaminated air.

If the unit is installed where windy conditions are common, install wind screens around the unit, maintaining the clearances specified above. This is particularly important to prevent blowing snow from entering outside air intakes and to maintain adequate head pressure control when mechanical cooling is required at low outdoor air temperatures. SpeedTrol, required for compressor operation below 45°F, maintains proper head pressure in calm wind conditions.

# <span id="page-83-0"></span>**Supply Power Wiring**

#### *Table 34: RPS/RFS/RCS/RDT Recommended Power Wiring*


1. Units require three-phase power supply.

- 2. Allowable voltage tolerances:
	- a. 60 Hertz
		- Nameplate 208V: Min. 187V, Max. 229V
		- Nameplate 230V: Min. 207V, Max. 253V
		- Nameplate 460V: Min. 414V, Max. 506V
		- Nameplate 575V: Min. 518V, Max. 633V
	- b. 50 Hertz
		- Nameplate 380V: Min. 360V, Max. 418V
- 3. Minimum Circuit Ampacity (MCA) Calculation:
- **NOTE:** If a unit is provided with multiple power connections, each must be considered alone in selecting power wiring components.

The MCA is calculated based on the following formulas:

- 1. Units with cooling and all heating except electric heat MCA = 1.25 × largest load + sum of all other loads
- 2. On units with electric heat, the MCA is computed both in the cooling mode and the heating mode and the greater of the two values is used.
	- a. Heating Mode
		- Electric heat less than or equal to 50 kW MCA = 1.25 (heater FLA + largest motor loads) + (the rest of the loads)
		- Electric heat greater than or equal to 50 kW MCA = 1.25 (largest motor load) + (the rest of the loads) + heater FLA
- **NOTE:** The compressor and condenser are not included in this heating mode calculation.
	- b. Cooling Mode
		- MCA = 1.25 × largest load + sum of all the other loads
	- 3. Size wires in accordance with Table 310-16 or 310-19 of the National Electrical Code.
	- 4. Wires should be sized for a maximum of 3% voltage drop.
	- 5. There are two options for the convenience outlet and light circuit power connections.
		- a. Separate Field Power, 120 V, 15 amps minimum This option provides optimal service and maintenance flexibility. Control circuit ampacity need not be considered in MCA calculations.
- **NOTE:** If the unit is provided with one or more fan section lights, they are powered from the separate 15 amp (minimum), 120V supply required by the NEC for the unit convenience outlet.
	- b. Unit Powered This option provides lowest installed cost. Control circuit ampacity must be added to unit ampacity if lights are ordered. Consult factory for details.
