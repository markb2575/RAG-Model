# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Overview**

## **The ThinLine Advantage**

ThinLine horizontal fan coils combine features most desired in a fan coil by building owners, specifying engineers and contractors alike. The result is a fan coil design that meets the needs of all three.

## **For building owners**

ThinLine fan coils offer quiet and energy efficient operation. They fully comply with [ASHRAE 62.1-2010](https://ashrae.org/) standards for high indoor air quality. And they offer a range of control options including BAS controls that can enhance occupant comfort and reduce operating costs. These units are also easy to maintain, with easy access to filters, fan motors and control systems. Fully concealed, Recessed or Exposed type units are available. Tamper-proof style cabinets are offered. A total of five color options, both as standard and special requests are available for a variety of decor styles.

## **For specifying engineers**

ThinLine fan coils provide great versatility. A variety of horizontal ceiling models are available with multiple arrangements and configurations.

- Coil options include two-, three-, and four-row primary coils to provide precise heating and cooling performance for any requirement. Separate, single-row standard or high capacity secondary heating coils (hot water or steam) are available in reheat or preheat arrangements. Preheat coils are also available with same or oppositeend coil connections.
- Multiple control options range from a simple wall or unit-mounted fan speed switch to a low-voltage interface board to a MicroTech controller board that can tie into most building automation systems. Non-communicating or communicating control options for LonTalk® and BACnet® are offered with the MicroTech option. Contact your Daikin representative for details.
- Discharge grille options include stamped or doubledeflection louvers. Open return or ducted return air is available, as well as stamped louvers for cabinet type units. Rear or bottom returns, front and bottom supply locations are offered.
- Appearance options include cabinet units with a durable, powder paint finish and decorative ceiling panels for recessed units in Cupola White or Antique Ivory. Other colors such as Off White, Putty Beige and Soft Gray are available. Custom colors can be matched as a special item. Tamper-proof units are a selectable option, with special screw head that prevent unauthorized access to unit interiors.
- Units are ETL and cETL listed. Performance is AHRI certified.

## **For contractors**

ThinLine fan coils feature Quick Ship options for fast delivery and a number of features that make installation fast and simple.

- Factory-mounted, wired and tested valve and piping packages for quick hookup to the building piping to reduce installation time. Packages can also be shipped loose with the unit for quick and easy field installation. Valve and piping packages are designed for entering water temperature sampling. This eliminates the need for inefficient bleed lines to sense automatic changeover on two-pipe units.
- Factory-mounted and tested controls minimize field setup. Depending on the option requested, controls can be wired with a 24 VAC transformer to provide a singlesource power connection to the unit. Several options are available for wall-mounted thermostats and unit or wallmounted sensors. All wall-mounted thermostat and zone sensors require only low-voltage control wiring from the device to the unit control box.
- Multiple convenient knockouts and easy bottom and end panel removal for hookup of electrical and piping connections minimizes field-labor time and cost.
- Opposite end connections minimize efforts for the replacement or retrofit process. Easy fan deck removal provides quick access for inspection, maintenance or repair.

8------------------------------------------------



## **Electric heater options**

Single-point power connection electric heaters are available for the following applications: 1) as total source of heat for the unit; 2) as supplementary (intermediate) source of heat between the seasons. Dual power connections are available when a motor and a heater are of different voltage.

The heater coils are fabricated of Nickel-Chromium high-grade resistance wire and are placed directly in front of the blower outlet. High limit thermal cut-out protects the heater in the event of insufficient air delivery.

## *Total electric heat*

Primary coil is used for cooling only. A single-stage electric heater provides total heat for the system. Individual room control can be provided for manual or automatic changeover.

### *Intermediate (supplementary) electric heat*

Primary coil is used for cooling or heating depending on the season and demand. In summer, while cold water is circulating in the system the fan coil unit will be cooling the space. In winter, the circulating hot water will make the fan coil unit heat the space. Between seasons, when the space control calls for heating, it will be provided by the electric heater.

9------------------------------------------------



## <span id="page-9-0"></span>**Control Options**

11------------------------------------------------



<span id="page-11-0"></span>## **MicroTech Controllers**

ThinLine fan coils can be provided with unit-mounted MicroTech controllers and multiple unit- or roommounted sensors.

MicroTech controllers can only be used with remote room sensors (described below) and not with remote thermostats.

A MicroTech controller is able to operate in either a stand-alone non-

communicating environment or a communicating environment. To operate in a communicating environment, a board named *communication module*, is installed on the unit controller. There are two types of communication modules available with MicroTech controllers: LonWorks and BACnet MSTP.

Unit controller sequences and controls: single- or multi-speed fans, two-position hydronic cooling and heating valves, floating three-wire hydronic cooling and heating valves, electric heat, ventilation dampers or economizers.

Unit controllers and/or I-O expansion boards have inputs for room or return temperatures, temperature setpoint adjustments, fan speed switches, entering water temperatures, discharge air temperatures, changeover auto switches, low temperature detection, emergency shutdown detection, condensate overflow detection, dirty air filter detection and occupancy. All sensors are software selectable and the controller is configured based on the selection.

## **Sensors**

## **Remote-mounted Room Temperature Sensor with Timed Override**

The Basic Sensor provides simple room temperature sensing all applications. Unit status is provided through a flashing LED located on the sensor while timed tenant override and fault reset are provided through the Override button.

## **Room Temperature Sensor with Setpoint Adjustable Module and Fan Speed Control**

The Digitally Adjustable sensor provides the ultimate of temperature control and display, simple user interface, alarm annunciation, and alarm reset. The easy to ready LCD clearly identifies the system operating mode including occupied/unoccupied mode, fan operation and control, unit status, timed override status, alarm annunciation, and energy savings mode through a series of recognizable icons. Tactile response buttons initiate adjustments for temperature set

points, system mode, fan mode, occupancy, tenant override and fault reset functions. The large numeric LCD will display space temperature (°F or °C) with the corresponding setpoint conditions. This sensor is designed for use with BACnet or LonWorks applications. However, it can also be installed as a standalone sensor using factory default set points.

## **Customer-Supplied Controls**

Your Daikin representative can work with engineers and/or contractors to factory install and wire other manufacturers' DDC controllers on the fan coil. Contact your local Daikin sales representative for assistance with your specific project.

12------------------------------------------------



## <span id="page-12-0"></span>**Factory Valve & Piping Packages**

Factory valve and piping packages are available for both two-pipe and four-pipe systems with either right or left hand connections. Four-pipe systems can be configured with the heating and cooling connections on the same or opposite sides of the unit. Packages can be either factory-installed or factory-assembled and shipped loose with the unit. All factoryassembled packages are fully leak tested. Units are also available without valve and piping packages in either a righthand or left-hand configurations.

Factory-installed packages are welded to the coil and wired to the unit control box, MicroTech controller or LV Interface Board. For field-installed packages, chilled and hot water pipes are the only field connections required. Piping is 1/2" nominal copper (5/8" OD).

*Figure 6: Four-pipe Deluxe Valve and Piping Package* 

Pre-determined field connection points are located for easy access. The installing contractor can pre-pipe the building water connections before the units arrive on the jobsite. A label clearly identifies chilled and hot water connection points on every unit.

All chilled water piping and components are located to allow condensate to drain into the secondary drain pan supplied with the valve package. Insulation of the factory piping package is not required.

## **Available Packages**

All factory-installed valve packages are flexible, configurable and fully software-selectable in our DaikinTools™ selection program. Custom valve packages are available also. Numerous piping packages are available to match design configurations. Additional components can be added to meet exact requirements, including P/T ports, unions, and flexible stainless steel hoses.

## *Basic Packages*

Basic valve and piping packages add control valves to the Shut-Off Only package. All Daikin control valves are factorymounted in the supply water pipe. See [Control Valve Options](#page-14-1)  [on page 15](#page-14-1) for more information on the variety of control valves available.

### *Figure 7: Basic Package*

## *Premium Packages*

Premium valve and piping packages replace the Basic package a ball valve in the return line with a manual or automatic circuit setter. The manual circuit setter is also known as a manual flow control valve. The auto circuit setter acts as both a flow setting device and a shut-off valve. It allows water flow through the fan coil to be set quickly and accurately. The circuit setter includes a cartridge within the valve body that is sized to allow a specific flow rate through the coil without any action required by a system piping balancer.

P/T ports are included, which are used to measure the temperature or pressure drop across the valve. This pressure drop can be compared to factory supplied tables that relate the pressure drop to a specific flow rate. The manual circuit setter valve also has a memory stop so that the correct setting can be found quickly.

NOTE: A bypass bleed line is installed on all factory provided fan coil valve packages with a 2-way control valve to prevent stagnation of water near the changeover switch (aqua-stat)or changeover sensor (10K pipe sensor). The bleed line allows 3 – 4 gpm of flow to bypass the coil which is necessary for the proper function of the automatic changeover system. All valve packages, cooling and heating, with a 2-way control valve automatically include the bypass bleed line. If the bleed line is unwanted, it may be crimped by the installing contractor to prevent bypass flow.

## *Deluxe Packages*

Deluxe valve and piping packages add a strainer to the Premium package. The strainer is available with or without an optional draining (blow-off) valve.

## <span id="page-14-1"></span><span id="page-14-0"></span>**Control Valve Options**

Except for Shut-off Only packages, all valve and piping packages include control valves for controlling water flow. All Daikin control valves are factory assembled and mounted in the supply water pipe downstream of the coil. Several options are available:

## *Two-Way/Two-Position Valves*

These valves will be either Fully-Open or Fully-Closed in response to a line voltage (115, 208-230 or 265-277 VAC) or 24 VAC signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. Some means of relieving pump head pressure should be applied when two-way valves are selected. Normally-Open or Normally-Closed valves are available, both spring-return type.

## *Three-Way Two-Position Valves*

These valves either allow full water flow through the coil or divert the flow through a bypass line. The valves respond to a line voltage (115, 203-230 or 265-277 VAC) or to 24 VAC signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. All standard three-way valves come with a fixed-balance orifice in a bypass line to compensate for flow balancing in the bypass position, eliminating the need for an additional balancing valve. Normally-Open or Normally-Closed valves are available.

## *Two-Way Modulating Valves*

These valves modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the Daikin thermostat or controller. Standard Daikin modulating valves are three-wire floating point equal percentage valves. Zero to 10 VDC proportional valves are also available. The modulating valves are factory mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil.

## *Three-Way Modulating Valves*

These valves modulate water flow through a coil in response to a signal from a Daikin thermostat or controller. Three-way valves allow water that is directed through the coil to mix with water that is directed through the bypass line. This mixture exits through the leaving water pipe. Modulating valves are three-wire, floating-point equal percentage valves or 0-10 VDC proportional. The modulating valves are factory mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil.

## *Selecting Correct Size Modulating Valves*

DaikinTools software automatically selects the best modulating valve size for the unit and coil being considered. By combining the [AHRI](http://www.ahrinet.org/site/1/Home) performance data, the coil flow rate and the DP across the water coil, the water coil Cv is calculated and the best matching modulating port size is selected. Valve and piping packages can easily be configured and automatically selected using Daikin Tools.

<span id="page-17-0"></span># **Unit Selection**

To achieve an efficient fan coil system, accurate system design and proper equipment selection is necessary. Variations, limitations/control of fan coil systems, design conditions and design load calculations are not described in detail in this catalog. More detailed information may be found in the [ASHRAE](https://ashrae.org/) Guide. This catalog contains AHRI-certified ratings and application ratings for ThinLine fan coil units from which a design engineer can make initial unit selections to meet system requirements.

A mechanical system designer must select the unit types best suited to the overall system before the actual unit sizes can be determined. The factors that generally influence this decision are: intended building usage, building layout, architectural and aesthetic values, economics, geographical location, and type of maintenance service available. The general results may be a mixture of unit types within a given system. Daikin Applied manufactures fan coil units to meet many needs including ThinLine, HiLine and Large Capacity models. For Daikin product information, please go to www.DaikinApplied.com.

## **Basic Design Data**

Prior to selecting individual unit sizes, a design engineer must fix or determine the following factors:

- Inside and outside wet and dry bulb design temperatures
- Total and sensible heat gains and losses of the area to be served
- Ventilation air
- Properties of the heating and cooling medium
- Available electric power service
- Any special design requirements of the building or system

## **Unit Size**

The capacity ratings presented in this catalog are provided for initial unit selection only. Water cooling and heating capacities, unit air flow, static pressure and glycol solutions are all incorporated into the program to provide the best possible selection. Consult your Daikin representative for a selection tailored to specific applications.

Unit sizes for the ideal system should be selected by calculating peak load requirements due to unusually high occupancy or severe climatic conditions and with fans operating at high speed. Ordinary day-to-day cooling and heating requirements are then achieved at low and medium speeds.

The initial unit selection should be checked for air volume in the design system and the cooling capacities checked against actual operating conditions. While units selected on the basis of sensible load will generally meet the total cooling load, total load should be checked in all cases.

The unit size is generally selected on the basis of matching the sensible cooling capacity of the unit with the calculated requirements when operating at high speed.

## **Coil Types**

Standard coils are designed to meet both cooling and heating requirements in a typical system. Two additional levels of enhanced primary coils are available to meet the total and sensible requirements of any application.

Heating requirements for two-pipe systems are generally met by employing the same water flow rate as cooling and adjusting the entering hot water temperature to obtain a matching unit heat output at low fan speed.

Four-pipe systems are generally designed by specifying the flow rate through the separate heating coil to meet the required heat load with the fan operating at the desired fan speed. Daikin offers two coil options for preheat and one option for reheat.

MCA (Minimum Circuit Ampacity), MOP (Maximum Overcurrent Protection) or MFS (Maximum Fuze Size) Calculations

The minimum circuit ampacity (MCA) is the minimum wire size required for a field-wired product. The maximum overcurrent protection (MOP), or maximum fuse size (MFS) is the maximum fuse or circuit breaker size required to properly protect the equipment.

Select a standard fuse size or HACR type circuit breaker equal to the MOP. Standard Fuse Sizes are: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60 amps. Use the next larger standard size if the MOP does not equal a standard size. See [Table 8](#page-22-1) and [Table 9](#page-23-0) for motor FLAs.

HACR (Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration) type circuit breakers are required in the branch circuit wiring for all fan coils with electric heat.

NOTE: MCA and MOP ratings are based on the unit and electric heat power supply having the same voltage. If the electric heat power supply is different, a separate circuit breaker may be required. Follow local codes.

Heater Amps = (Heater kW × 1000) Heater Voltage

- NOTE: Use 120V heater voltage for 115V units. Use 240V heater voltage for 230V units.
- MCA = 1.25 × (heater amps + all motor FLAs)

MOP or MFS = (2.25 x Largest Motor FLA) + Second Motor FLA + Heater Amps [If Applicable]

### **2.07 VALVE PACKAGES**

- A. Fan coil units shall be provided with factory-installed valve / piping package(s)available for the primary and secondary coils. All piping packages shall be factory assembled and tested at 400 psig (2760 kPa) and re-tested for leak when factory soldered to the coil(s) at 300 psig (2069 kPa) Maximum Working Pressure of the piping package shall be 300 psig (2069 kPa).
- B. The valve package shall be designed so that any condensation is directed into the secondary drain pan. With the secondary drain pan provided, insulation of the piping package is not required.
- C. The valve package shall be provided with:
	- 1. Interconnecting copper piping and shut-off ball valves.
	- 2. Connecting supply and return lines to the unit. Four-pipe packages shall include a venting valve for the preheat or reheat coil.
	- 3. P/T ports to measure the temperature or pressure drop across the valve. This pressure drop can be compared to factory-supplied curves that relate the pressure drop to a specific flow rate.
	- 4. Unions at the coil connections.
	- 5. A 20 mesh strainer on the supply side that is easily removed for cleaning, with a blow-off valve. The strainer shall have a pressure rating of up to 400 psig (2,758 kPa).
	- 6. Isolating ball valve on the supply side.
	- 7. Balancing flow valve with isolating ball valve on the return with:

A manual circuit setter in the return water pipe. The circuit setter acts as both a flowsetting device and a shut-off valve. It allows water flow through the fan coil to be set quickly and accurately. The valve shall have a memory stop so that the correct setting can be found quickly.

or

An automatic circuit setter. The circuit setter includes a cartridge within the valve body that is sized to allow a specific flow rate through the coil. This valve sets flow through the coil without any action required by a system piping balancer.

- 8. Control valves in the supply water pipe.
- 9. Two-Way/Two-Position Valves that are fully open or fully closed in response to a line voltage (115 or 265-277 VAC) or a 24 VAC signal from the Daikin Applied thermostat or controller. Some means of relieving pump head pressure should be accounted for when two-way valves are selected. Normally open or normally closed valves are available. Both are spring-return.
- 10. Three-Way, Two-Position Valves that either allow full water flow through the coil or divert the flow through a bypass line. The valves respond to a line voltage (115 or 265-277 VAC) or to a 24 VAC signal from the Daikin Applied thermostat or controller. All standard three-way valves come with a fixed-balance orifice in the bypass line to compensate for flow balancing in the bypass position, eliminating the need for an additional balancing valve. Normally open or normally closed valves are available.
- 11. Two-Way Modulating Valves that modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the Daikin Applied thermostat or controller. All standard Daikin Applied modulating valves are three-wire floating point equal percentage valves. The modulating valves are factory mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil.
- 12. Three-Way Modulating Valves that modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the Daikin Applied thermostat or controller. Three-way valves allow water that is directed through the coil to mix with water that is directed through the bypass line. This mixture exits through the leaving water pipe. All modulating valves are three-wire, floating-point equal percentage valves.

## **2.08 FILTERS**

A. Filters shall be 1" (25 mm) throwaway. They shall be concealed from sight and easily removable.

### **2.09 MICROTECH CONTROLS**

- A. The unit control board shall be the main component of the system and shall contain the required inputs/ outputs to operate a fan coil unit.
- B. Unit controller inputs/outputs: The MicroTech controller will be microprocessor-based and have capabilities, performance, and memory sufficient to execute the various functions detailed in this specification. This document will not specify a type, a manufacturer, or a family of microcontrollers to be considered for use. However, at a minimum, the following features are deemed essential:
	- 1. Analog Inputs: Room or Return Temperature & Timed Override Switch, Condensate Overflow, Set point Adjust, Fan Speed Switch, Heat/Cool/ Auto Switch, Entering Water Temperature, Discharge Air Temperature.
	- 2. Condensate Overflow. The presence of excessive condensate in the condensate drain pan is detected by a condensate sensor, which consists of a metal terminal ring mounted just below the top of the condensate pan. The analog input dedicated to condensate sensing must be capable of detecting the conductivity of water between the ring terminal and chassis ground. The conductivity trip point is 2.5 micro-ohms.

36------------------------------------------------



- 3. Set point Adjust. The Set point Adjust range will be interpreted by the base controller as an offset to the current temperature setpoint -5 to +5 degrees F or a range of 55 to 95 degrees F (software jumper selectable and scaled accordingly in software).
- 4. Heat/Cool/Auto The Room Sensor shall incorporate a voltage signal that present different values to a single analog input which correspond to the unit operating mode functions detailed below. The room sensor is designed with specific voltage values to coincide with the software in unit control module.
- 5. Fan Speed Switch The Room Sensor shall incorporate a voltage signal that present different voltage values to a single analog input which correspond to the fan speed mode functions detailed below. The room sensor is designed with specific voltage values to coincide with the software in unit control module.
- 6. Temperature Input. Sensing element in the MicroTech room temperature sensor is equivalent to NTC Thermistor – 10K ohms @ 25°C, 0.2°C interchangeability. Advanced Thermal Products – Curve Z. NOTE: The Timed (Tenant) Override switch will short out the Room sensor thermistor. Sensing range shall be 0 to 158°F with a resolution of 1°F and an accuracy of +/- 1.5°F Maximum Total Error.
- 7. Binary Inputs. 2 total (Freeze Fault Detection, Occupancy Sensor)
- C. Binary Outputs: 9 total (Fan Low Speed, Fan Medium Speed, Fan High Speed, Valve Output #1, Valve Output #2, Valve Output #3, or Electric Heat Stage 1, Valve Output #4 or Electric Heat Stage 2, 2 Position Damper, Room Sensor Status LED).
	- 1. Fan Speed Outputs -There are three fan speed outputs on baseboard. If all three outputs are de-energized, the fan motor is off. Only a single type (low, medium, high) of speed output shall be turned on when fan operation is required.
	- 2. Two-Position Damper Output: Binary output may be used to open a fresh air ventilation damper. If the output is de-energized, the damper is closed. If the output is energized, the damper is open.
	- 3. Room Sensor Status Output: Binary output may be used to energize and de-energize an indicator located on the room sensor. See Room Sensor Status Output Annunciation Table.
- D. Automatic Fan speed selection.
	- 1. When the fan mode/speed switch is in the "Auto" position and capacity is required, the fan speed is determined automatically based on the amount of error from the respective heating or cooling on setpoint. If the room temperature error exceeds 4°F (2.22°C), the fan will be "forced on" in the highest available fan speed. Once the room temperature error falls below 3°F (1.67°C), the fan will no longer be "forced on" in the highest available fan speed. If the "Highest Speed Force On" is not active the fan will start at low speed, and fan speed changes are determined by whether the room temperature is above or below the effective controlling on setpoint.
- E. Valve and Electric Heat Control
	- 1. The controller will be factory configurable for the following valve and electric heat control configurations.
- F. Software Jumpers
	- 1. Software Jumpers will be designed into the MicroTech Fan Coil controller and used to modify controller configuration to match equipment configuration. The values of the jumper's (zero or one) shall set valve operation, fan operation, etc. Software Jumper definitions are below

37------------------------------------------------



- G. Intelligent Reset: (Condensate Overflow Alarm). The "Fault Retry" feature helps to minimize nuisance trips of automatic lockouts caused by low-pressure or low temperature faults. This feature automatically clears these faults the first two times they occur within a 24-hour period and triggers an automatic lockout on the 3rd fault. The retry count is reset to zero every 24 hours. The fault retry feature does not apply to a high pressure fault – which causes an immediate lockout and requires a manual reset, or condensate overflow or brownout faults – which are self-clearing.
- H. MicroTech Unit Controller Status LED: Remote LED boards will provide visual feedback.
	- 1. Room Sensor Status LED: A 5VDC signal and shall operate as follows:
- I. Warranty The contractor shall provide one full year warranty for furnishing parts on site which becomes defective in normal operation, from the date of start-up by the manufacturer's representative, or first beneficial use of the unit.
	- 1. Manufacturer's warranty time periods may or may not coincide with the contractor's time period of obligation, but where the manufacturer's warranty contains an expiration date based upon the equipment shipping date, the contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility for covering the full time periods listed above.
	- 2. The contractor shall be responsible for all shipping expenses not included by the manufacturer, both to procure the replacement part, and to return any defective parts to the manufacturer, as they may require.
	- 3. The contractor's replacement warranty obligation after the first year shall be limited to furnishing of replacement parts only, and shall not include repair labor costs or materials such as refrigerant, oils, dehydration, refrigerant- moisture dryers, air filters, or drive belts.
	- 4. The owner shall be responsible for providing replacement filters beyond the spares provided in the original contract, and for filter installation labor.
