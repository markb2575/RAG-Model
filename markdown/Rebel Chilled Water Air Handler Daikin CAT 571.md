This outdoor air monitor is ideal for low velocity ventilation control, sensitivity to air flow increases as flow rate decreases, and accuracy is a percent of reading. Competitive pitot tube and pressure drop alternatives have very little sensitivity at low velocities and accuracy is a percent of full scale readings.

Monitor and controller comply with the measurement portion of the Outdoor Air Delivery Monitoring LEED® Point EQc1.

This option is factory installed, calibrated and tested to reduce installation costs and risks. End-users only need to enter the outdoor air flow set point into the MicroTech III controller.

# *Figure 7: OA Monitor and Controller*

**OA Monitor OA Controller**

# **OA Monitor/Controller Application**

The outdoor air monitor measures the airflow and sends the appropriate analog signal to the MicroTech III controller, which in turn modulates the outdoor air damper to maintain proper ventilation levels. The desired outdoor air flow set point is directly entered at the MicroTech III controller keypad or is read from the BAS.

Measured outdoor air CFM can be displayed on the MicroTech III controller, as well as the outdoor air monitor, and MicroTech III writes this value to the BAS.

All BAS communication is done through the optional, MicroTech III, LON®, or BACnet® communication cards.

The outdoor air monitor option is available on all economizer, 100% outdoor air, and energy recovery options as well as the 0-30% outdoor air option.

Control accuracy may exceed +/- 15% when the energy recovery wheel bypass dampers are open. This only occurs during economizer operation, at which time more than enough ventilation air is provided.

8------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Outdoor/Return Air Section**

Rebel units are available with a 0% to 30% outdoor air damper, a 0% to 100% economizer or also a 100% outdoor air option.

- For better serviceability an optional non-fused disconnect switch is optionally mounted inside the control panel and operated by an externally mounted handle for disconnecting electrical power at the unit

# **Control Valve Options**

Except for shut-off only packages, all valve and piping packages include control valves for controlling water flow. All Daikin control valves are factory assembled and mounted in the supply water pipe upstream of the coil. Several options are available:

# **2-Way Modulating Valves**

These valves modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the MicroTech III controller. The actuator uses a 2 to 10 VDC proportional signal

# **3-Way Modulating Valves**

These valves modulate the water flow through the coil in response to a signal from the MicroTech III controller. 3-way valves allow water that is directed through the coil to mix with water that is directed through the bypass line. This mixture exits through the leaving water pipe. The actuator uses a 2 to 10 VDC proportional signal.

# **Isolation Valves**

These valves are available with and without the control valves. They are manual ball valves that provide the ability to isolate the water flow through the heating or cooling coil.

10------------------------------------------------



**Application Considerations**

<span id="page-10-0"></span>Daikin Rooftop units are intended for use in normal heating, ventilating, and air conditioning applications. Consult your local Daikin sales representative for applications involving operations at high ambient temperatures, high altitudes, noncataloged voltages, or for job specific unit selections that fall outside of the range of the catalog tables.

For proper operation, units should be rigged in accordance with instructions stated in the Rebel Air Handler installation manual IM 1260). Fire dampers, if required, must be installed in the ductwork according to local and/or state codes. No space is allowed for these dampers in the unit. Follow factory check, test and start procedures explicitly to achieve satisfactory start-up and operation (see IM 1260). Most rooftop applications take advantage of the significant energy savings provided with economizer operation. When an economizer system is used, mechanical cooling is typically not required below an ambient temperature of 50°F.

# **Unit Location**

The structural engineer must verify that the roof has adequate strength and ability to minimize deflection. Take extreme caution when using on a wooden roof structure. Unit condenser coils should be in a location that avoids any heated exhaust air.

Allow sufficient space around the unit for maintenance/ service clearance. Refer to [Figure 9 on page 12](#page-11-0) and [page](#page-12-0)  [13](#page-12-0)for recommended clearances. Consult your Daikin sales representative if available clearances do not meet minimum recommendations. Where code considerations, such as the NEC, require extended clearances, these take precedence.

# **Service Clearance**

Allow for recommended service clearances as shown in [Figure](#page-11-0)  [9](#page-11-0). Provide a roof walkway along the sides of the unit for service and access to controls and components. Contact your Daikin sales representative for service requirements less than those recommended.

# **Curb Installation**

The roof curb is field-assembled and must be installed level (within 1/16" per foot side to side). A sub-base must be constructed by the contractor in applications involving pitched roofs. Gaskets are furnished and must be installed between the unit and curb. For proper installation, follow NRCA guidelines. Typical curb installation is illustrated in [Figure 10 on page 14](#page-13-0) through [Figure 13 on page 17.](#page-16-0)

In applications requiring post and rail installation, an I-beam securely mounted on multiple posts should support the unit on each side. In addition, the insulation on the underside of the unit should be protected from the elements.

Applications in geographic areas subjected to seismic or hurricane conditions must meet code requirements for fastening the unit to the curb and the curb to the building structure.

<span id="page-17-0"></span># **Acoustical Considerations**

Good acoustical design is critical for any installation and should start at the earliest stages in the design process. Common sound paths for rooftop equipment must be addressed are:

- Radiated sound through the bottom of the unit (air handling section and condensing section) and into the space
- Radiated sound to the property line
- Structure-borne vibration from the unit to the building
- Airborne sound through the supply air duct
- Airborne sound through the return air duct

Locating rooftop equipment away from sound sensitive areas is critical and the most cost effective means of avoiding sound problems. If possible, rooftop equipment should always be located over less sensitive areas such as corridors, toilet facilities or auxiliary spaces and away from office areas, conference rooms and classrooms. Some basic guidelines for good acoustical performance are:

- Provide proper structural support under all areas of the unit
- Always locate the unit's center of gravity close to a main support to minimize roof deflection
- Use a concrete deck or pad when a unit has to be located over an occupied space where good acoustics are essential
- Only the supply and return air ducts should penetrate the acoustical material and decking within the curb perimeter, and the openings must be sealed once the duct is installed
- Don't overlook the return air path. Never leave a clear "line of sight" into a return or exhaust fan; always include some duct work (acoustically lined tee) at the return inlet
- Place acoustical material in the area directly beneath the condensing section
- Select acoustical material that discourages microbial growth
- Minimize system static pressure losses to reduce fan sound generation
- Design duct systems to minimize turbulence
- Account for low frequency duct breakout in system design. Route the first 20 ft. of rectangular duct over non-sensitive areas and avoid large duct aspect ratios. Consider round or oval duct to reduce breakout

There are many sound sources in rooftop systems. Fans, compressors, condenser fans, duct take-offs, etc., all generate sound. For guidelines on reducing sound generation in the duct system, refer to the ASHRAE Applications Handbook. Contact your local Daikin sales representative for equipment supply, return and radiated sound power data specific to your application.

# **Ductwork Considerations**

A well-designed duct system is required to allow the rooftop equipment to provide rated performance and to minimize system resistance and sound generation. Duct connections to and from units should allow straight, smooth airflow transitions. Avoid any abrupt change in duct size and sharp turns in the fan discharge. Avoid turns opposed to wheel rotation since they generate air turbulence and result in unwanted sound. If 90° turns are necessary, use turning vanes. Refer to the ASHRAE Applications Handbook for specific guidelines relevant to rooftop equipment.

# **Return Duct**

The return path is the most often overlooked. A section of return duct is required to avoid a "line of sight" to the return air opening and to provide attenuation of return air sound. Install an insulated tee with a maximum duct velocity of 1000 to 1200 feet per minute. Extend the duct 15 feet to provide adequate attenuation.

# **Supply Duct**

Insulate supply air ductwork for at least the first 20 feet from the unit. Consider the use of round or oval ductwork, as it significantly reduces low frequency breakout noise near the equipment. If rectangular duct is used, keep the aspect ratio of the duct as low as possible. The large flat surfaces associated with high aspect ratios increase low frequency breakout to the space and can generate noise, such as "oil canning." The maximum recommended supply duct velocity is 1800 to 2000 feet per minute.

# **Duct High Limit**

A Daikin Packaged System with VAV control includes a duct high limit switch as a standard feature that is of particular importance when fast acting, normally-closed boxes are used.

# **Vibration Isolation**

Make duct attachments to the unit with a flexible connection. Economizer and Exhaust Fan Application Rooftop economizer applications usually require exhaust fans to properly control building pressure and maintain minimum ventilation. The air balancer must adjust the outdoor air damper to provide minimum ventilation settings. The EAF is normally-off during non-economizer operation. During these minimum outdoor air conditions, the system essentially acts like a supply fan only system.

18------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Smoke and Fire Protection**

Due to the wide variation in building design and ambient operating conditions our units are applied, we do not represent or warrant that our products are fit and sufficient for smoke, fume, and fire control purposes. The owner and a fully qualified building designer are responsible for meeting all local and NFPA building code requirements with respect to smoke, fume, and fire control. The unit's control panel has a terminal block that a supply air and return air smoke detector can be wired to. An optional return air smoke detector is offered. Any other smoke detector, its installation, and the wiring to the unit controller are all field supplied.

# **Variable Air Volume Application**

Rebel units include ECM supply and exhaust fans to provide variable air volume (VAV) control as shown in [Figure 14.](#page-18-1) Daikin Rebel variable air volume systems (VAV) employ the concept of varying the air quantity to a space at a constant temperature, thereby balancing the heat gains or losses and maintaining the desired room temperature. This ability to reduce supply air quantities not only provides substantial fan energy savings at partial load conditions, but it also minimizes equipment sizing. Variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

<span id="page-18-1"></span>## *Figure 14: Variable Air Volume (VAV) Control*

- Lower system first cost by using system diversity to reduce equipment and duct sizes
- Lower operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions
- Provides excellent acoustics at lower air flows

In placing a duct static pressure sensor, locate a pressure tap near the end of the main duct trunk. Adjust the static pressure setpoint so that at minimum airflow all of the terminals receive the minimum static pressure required plus any downstream resistance. Locate the static pressure sensor tap in the ductwork in an area free from turbulence effects and at least ten duct diameters downstream and several duct diameters upstream from any major interference, including branch takeoffs.

# **Single Zone Variable Air Volume Application**

A unit configured for single zone VAV will use discharge air control for mechanical cooling and heat, with VAV control of the supply air fan based upon the space or return air temperature. During cooling, the MicroTech III controller increases the ECM fan motor speed when the space temperature rises above the setpoint, and it decreases fan speed when space temperatures approach the setpoint. Mirror-image heating control is also provided. The MicroTech III controller will also use the control temperature to transition between cooling, fan only, and heating modes. Singlezone variable volume systems offer the following advantages:

- Lower system first cost
- Lower operating costs by reducing fan energy demands, especially at part load conditions
- Provides excellent acoustics at lower air flows

# **Fan Operating Range**

The acceptable system operating range of the Daikin rooftop is determined by all of the following characteristics. Each of these limiting factors must be considered for proper performance and component design life:

- Unstable fan operation
- Maximum fan rpm
- Maximum cabinet static pressure
- Maximum face velocity (cooling coil is most important)
- Minimum furnace velocity
- Turndown capability on VAV applications
- Compressor operating pressures

# **Indoor Fan and Motor Heat**

The indoor fan and motor electrical consumption is a sensible cooling load approximately equal to 2.8 MBh per bhp (depending slightly on motor efficiency). The fan and motor temperature rise is equal to Btuh/(1.08 × cfm) and is typically about 3°F.

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Altitude Adjustments**

# **Fan Curve Performance**

Fan curve performance is based on 70°F air temperature and sea level elevation. Selections at any other conditions require adjustment for air densities listed in [Table 1.](#page-19-1) Higher elevations generally require more rpm to provide a given static pressure but less bhp due to the decrease in air density.

# *Example:*

.

Assume 2,000 cfm is required at 1.00" TSP. The elevation is 5000 ft. and 70°F average air temperature is selected. A 14" SWSI airfoil fan is selected.

- 1. The density adjustment factor for 5000 ft. and 70°F is 0.83.
- 2. TSP must be adjusted as follows: 1.0" / 0.83 = 1.20".
- 3. Locate 2,000 cfm and 1.2 on the fan curve. Rpm = 1720 and bhp = 0.53.
- <span id="page-19-1"></span>4. Consumed fan power at design = 0.53 bph × 0.83 = 0.44 bhp.

*Table 1: Temperature and Altitude Conversion Factors*


# **Furnace Performance**

Gas heat performance data is based on standard 70°F air temperature and zero feet altitude (sea level).

For altitudes between 2000 to 6000 feet, the gas burner must be derated 4% for every 1000 feet of altitude.

# *Example:*

A 400 MBh furnace at an altitude of 3000 feet is derated (0.04 × 3 = 0.12). At 400 MBh input (400 × 0.12 MBh), the actual input is (400 - 48 = 352 MBh) at 3000 feet.

For altitudes above 6000 feet, consult the factory.

# **System Operating Limits**

Daikin DAH systems are designed to operate over an extensive operating range. However, for proper system operation some limits do apply.

To help prevent moisture blow-off, design guidelines have been established for cooling coil selection. For applications outside of these limits, consult your Daikin sales representative.

In addition to maximum face velocity limitations, minimum velocity guidelines must also be followed. In order to maintain proper refrigeration performance, the minimum coil face velocity is 150 ft./min. When selecting a variable air volume unit, it is necessary to design the system such that the 150 ft./ min. limit is maintained at light load conditions.

# **Condensate Drainage**

Provide all drain pans with a properly sized p-trap to allow free drainage of coil condensate. For trap sizing, follow instruction given in the Rebel air handler installation manual. Run all traps and drain lines full size from the threaded unit connection to the roof drain.

# **Zone Sensor Placement**

Placement of the zone temperature sensor is critical for proper and economical operation of the heating and cooling system. It is generally recommended that the space sensor be located on an inside wall (3 to 5 feet from an outside wall) in a space having a floor area of at least 400 square feet. Do not locate the sensor below the outlet of a supply diffuser, in the direct rays of the sun, on a wall adjacent to an unheated or abnormally warm room (boiler or incinerator room), or near any heat producing equipment. Where zone sensor placement is a problem, all zone control systems, as standard, have the capability to use a return air sensor for heating and cooling.

<span id="page-20-0"></span># **Unit Wiring**

All units require three phase, 60 Hz, 208, 230, 460, and 575 volt power supply. All units include branch circuits and short circuit protection and are available with a power block or nonfused disconnect switch. Each unit is provided with a 120 V convenience outlet.

All wiring must be installed in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) and local codes.

# **Winter Shipment**

Flat bed shipment in winter can expose units to harsh road chemicals. Since equipment size and configuration precludes covering during transit, wash units free of these chemicals as soon as possible to help prevent corrosion.

# **Coil Freeze Protection**

When applying roof-mounted equipment in areas that experience subfreezing conditions, coil freeze protection measures must be provided. Subfreezing temperatures can adversely affect water and steam coils during controlled or uncontrolled unit shutdowns and even during unit operation. Daikin economizer dampers are arranged to direct the outside and return air streams toward each other, however, there may not always be a uniform unit temperature profile under all load and ambient temperatures. Some temperature stratification will occur, particularly at low ambient temperatures and the associated reduced airflow inherent with VAV systems.

Glycol is strongly recommended as a positive means of freeze protection for water coils. No control sequence can prevent coil freezing in the event of a power failure or equipment malfunction. During those periods, glycol is the only positive means of freeze protection. When selecting water coils, specify glycol to account for performance differences.

# **Parallel Air Paths on Energy Recovery Wheel Applications**

# **Economizer Units**

There are three sets or parallel air flow paths on economizer units:

## **Set 1: OA and RA paths to the SAF**

- The OA path APD is normally greater than the RA path APD. Therefor, the air balancer must adjust the RA dampers to not open fully so that sufficient OA is achieved
- The RA path includes return duct ESP. Normally, the SAF handles both of these paths. Therefore, the EAF need not handle the return duct ESP. However:
	- The RA path is not open during economizer operation, so the EAF must handle return duct ESP during economizer operation or excessive positive building pressure will occur
- For VAV units, note that RA cfm during economizer operation normally is less that design return cfm
- An energy analysis must be careful not to overwhelm the EAF with return duct ESP except during economizer cooling

**Set 2: OA wheel and OA bypass path to the SAF**

**Set 3: EA wheel and bypass path to the EAF** 

# **100% Outdoor Air Units**

There are no parallel flow paths in a 100% OA unit. Instead, there is one counter-flow path (OA and EA paths throughout the wheel). The EAF must be sized for design return duct cfm and ESP as well as the wheel and wheel prefilter pressure drop.
