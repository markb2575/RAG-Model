## **Hot Gas Reheat Coil**

For improved indoor climate control, Daikin Applied offers accurate and cost effective dehumidification control using a hot gas reheat option known as smart dehumidification. Hot gas reheat with smart dehumidification is an excellent solution for applications where maintaining low humidity in a space is crucial.

With smart dehumidification, once the space temperature is satisfied, the humidistat signal diverts the high temperature refrigerant gas to the reheat coil located downstream of the cooling coil. The conditioned and reheated air prevents over cooling of the space and maximizes moisture removal for improved indoor comfort. With the optional ECM fan system, the air flow is adjusted for optimal moisture removal, and helps keep sound levels at a minimum. It is especially effective during low load conditions when proper control is critical.

## **Waterside Economizer**

The waterside economizer option helps to reduce energy consumption by using cold loop water temperature to condition a space without energizing mechanical cooling. Even in the coldest weather a space can experience a build-up of ambient heat from people, equipment, lighting and the sun.

Buildings benefit from the waterside economizer when loop temperatures are cool enough to provide air condi-

### tioning.

The waterside economizer includes a hydronic cooling coil, 3-way motorized valve and an entering water sensor located upstream of the unit's evaporator coil.

When entering water temperatures are between 40° to 70°F, a call for 1st-stage cooling will divert the cold water to the economizer coil. A call for 2nd-stage cooling will allow simultaneous compressor operation whenever the loop temperature is below the changeover temperature.

## **Designed-in Sound Reduction**

Provided as standard, the unit has a unique dual-level vibration isolation system. A heavy-gauge mounting plate is isolated from the cabinet base with a 1/2" thick dense foam pad to minimize vibration transfer. The compressor is then isolated from the mounting plate with isolation grommets. The compressor is located in a well-insulated compartment separated from the air stream to minimize sound transmission.

### **Cabinet Insulation**

Dual density 1/2" fiberglass insulation is standard on all al Compact units for improved thermal and acoustic performance. The insulation meets NFPA 90A/90B requirements, air erosion and mold growth limits of UL-181, fungal resistance test per ASTM G21 or ASTM C 1338, and meets zero level bacteria growth per ASTM G22. All insulation has a flame spread of less than 25 and a smoke developed classification of less than 50 per ASTM E-84 and UL 723.

9------------------------------------------------

# **Hoses, Hose Kits and Shutoff Ball Valves for SmartSource Water Source Heat Pumps**

Daikin offers a variety of flexible supply, return and condensate hoses and hose assemblies for connecting its water source heat pumps to a building's hard piping system. See catalog [1196](http://salesportal.daikinapplied.com/bizlit/DocumentStorage/WaterSourceHeatPump/Catalogs/CAT_1196-11_Hose_Kits_for_WSHPs_LR.pdf) for the complete hose and hose kit offering.

*Figure 2: Flexible, steel braided supply and return hoses*

Supply and return hoses have a swivel fitting at one end to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service.

Standard supply and return fire-rated hoses have either a thermoplastic rubber or synthetic polymer core with a braided covering of stainless steel. Fittings are either plated steel or brass.

*Table 3: Available fire rated supply and return hoses*


### **Supply and Return Hose Kits**

*Figure 3: Supply and return hoses*

## **Supply Hose - Combination Ball Valve and Strainer**

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Applications**

# **Typical Horizontal Installation**

### *Unit Location*

It is important to leave enough space for service personnel to perform maintenance or repair. Locate the horizontal unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access and do not install the unit above any piping. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out. Each unit is suspended from the ceiling by four 3/8" threaded rods fastened to the unit by a hanger bracket and rubber isolator. The design should place the unit directly below the structural members so that it is securely anchored. The unit should be hung level as the drain pan is internally pitched.

Avoid installing units directly above spaces where building occupants will reside (e.g. above office desks or classrooms) to reduce the requirement for noise attenuation. Do not place units above high traffic areas because service access may be limited during occupied hours. For example, units are typically installed above the hallway drop ceiling in schools and the supply and return air is routed directly into classrooms. Local code may require fire dampers to be used with this application.

18------------------------------------------------



# <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Ductwork and Attenuation**

### *Horizontal Unit*

Ductwork is normally applied to ceiling-mounted heat pumps on the discharge side of the unit. A discharge collar is provided on all horizontal unit models for fastening the ductwork. Use a flexible connector between the discharge collar and the duct transformation to help reduce vibration transmission from the cabinet and to simplify disconnection of the unit from the ceiling ductwork. If return ductwork is to be used, attach a flexible connector to the filter rack collar to help reduce vibration transmission and removal of the unit. Return plenum ducting should be at least 12 inches away from the coil so that the coil is evenly loaded with return air.

As a general recommendation, duct interiors should have an acoustic / thermal lining at least 1/2 inch thick over the entire duct run. For better sound attenuation, line the last five diameters of duct before each register with a one-inch thick sound blanket. Elbows, tees and dampers can create turbulence or distortion in the airflow. Place a straight length of duct, 5 to 10 times the duct width, before the next fitting to smooth out airflow. Diffusers that are located in the bottom of a trunk duct can also produce noise. For this same reason, volume control dampers should be located several duct widths upstream from an air outlet.

#### *Figure 6: Horizontal unit duct example*

<span id="page-19-0"></span>## **Piping**

The water source heat pump unit is typically connected to the supply / return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydronic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required. Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

Daikin has available optional hose kit combinations to better facilitate system flow balancing. These flexible hoses reduce vibration between the unit and the rigid piping system.

Polyolester Oil, commonly know as POE oil is a synthetic oil used in many refrigeration systems. POE oil, if ever in contact with PVC/CPVC will coat the inside wall of PVC/CPVC pipe causing environmental stress fractures.

Please keep this in mind when selecting piping materials for your application, as system failure and property damage could result. For these reasons Daikin Applied does not recommend the use of PVC/CPVC water piping.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>## **Water System Quality**

The cleaning, flushing and chemical treatment of a water source heat pump system is fundamental to efficient operation and the life expectancy of the system.

Potential system problems produced by the use of water fall into three general categories:

- **1. Scale formation**  Mineral deposits which result from the crystallization and precipitation of dissolved salts in the water. The deposits form an insulating barrier, reducing the heat transfer rate and impeding the circulation of fluids due to increased pressure drop.
- **2. Corrosion** Decomposition of the metal caused by absorption of gases from the air. Corrosion may occur in any metal component of the system.
- **3. Organic growths** Slime and algae which form under certain environmental conditions, and can reduce the heat transfer rate by forming an insulating coating or can promote corrosion by pitting.

The system water should be evaluated for degrees of impurity, with testing available from independent testing labs, health departments or state agencies.

[Table 4](#page-20-1) is a list of water characteristics, the potential impurities and their results and the recommended treatment.

### *Avoiding Potential Problems*

As shown in [Table 4](#page-20-1), all water contains some degree of impurities which may affect the performance of a heat pump system. The use of a cupro-nickel coil can help avoid potential problems. Water flow rates should:

- **A.** Be high enough that the temperature rise through the heat exchanger does not exceed 10° F when operating in the cooling mode.
- **B.** Not exceed 4 GPM per nominal ton. Flow rates that have velocities of 10 feet per second or more may cause pipe erosion and heat exchanger failure.


#### <span id="page-20-1"></span>*Table 4: Water impurities, result & recommended water system application*

*Notes: 1. The tremendous variety in water quality around the country makes the recommendation of a single best method of treatment impossible. Consult a local water treatment specialist for specific treatment recommendations.*

*2. Cupro-Nickel is recommended if iron bacteria is present, suspended solids or dissolved oxygen levels are high.*

*3. If the concentration of these corrosives exceeds the maximum tabulated in the cupro-nickel column, then the potential for serious corrosion problems exists.*

<span id="page-21-0"></span>## **Condensate Drain**

Compact horizontal units have a 3/4-inch FPT condensate drain connection, flush to the unit. The drain pan is internally pitched. The field installed condensate piping must include a trap after the connection and be pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

Improper trapping can lead to several problems. If the trap is too tall, negative pressure will prevent drainage, causing condensate backup. If the trap is too short the seal will be destroyed or nonexistent, producing the same effect as a non-trapped system.

Construct the trap of 7/8" clear plastic piping. The condensate piping from the drain trap must be sloped to facilitate proper drainage. The clear plastic trap should be clamped and removable for cleaning. It may be necessary to manually fill the trap at system startup, or to run the unit for sufficient time to build a condensate seal. The condensate trap and condensate piping drainage should be free of any foreign debris. Debris can prevent proper drainage and unit operation and result in condensate buildup.

# **Operating Limits**

#### *Table 5: Air limits in °F (°C)*


#### *Table 6: Fluid limits*


*Notes: 1 Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Extended range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.*

*2 This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such a start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

*3 Unit with waterside economizer option can operate in economizer cooling mode down to 40*°*F (4*°*C).*

### **Fan Performance For Optional Constant Torque EC Motor (Sizes 007–012)**

*Table 8: Constant torque EC motor CFM values*


*Notes: 1. Gray tinted areas, outside recommended operating range.*

*2. Units are shipped at setting 3 (standard). Speed adjustment is done by 4-position switch in the control box.*

*3. The unit is capable of high-low fan performance through the use of a 2-stage thermostat wired to specific terminals for High-Low CFM fan performance. Standard operation with a 1-stage thermostat is indicated as stage 2 fan performance.*

*\* Exception - WSE operates at row "C" airflows.*

*Note: See [Table 11 on page](#page-26-0) 27 for jumper configuration location.*
