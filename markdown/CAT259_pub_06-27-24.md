## OVERVIEW

### Environmentally Friendly

Rebel Applied's heat pump technology uses electricity to move heat, rather than generating heat directly. This results in lower carbon emissions and a more environmentally friendly heating and cooling solution for various climate regions and seasons. So much so, that many government financial incentives are available to encourage adoption of the technology.

Heating and cooling

5,000-29,000 cfm

R-32 refrigerant

Up to 20.0 IEER

20-75 tons

The Rebel Applied heat pump system utilizes advanced variable speed compressors and electronic commutated motor fans to enable precise temperature control while minimizing energy waste to ensure optimal performance, sustainable operation, and lessen impact on your building's financial budget.

### Low GWP Refrigerant

With a GWP of 675, R-32 contributes less to global warming potential compared to other refrigerants like R-410A. Because of R-32's excellent thermodynamic performance characteristics, an R-32 system could have up to 40% less charge than R-410A in certain applications, meaning you could reduce refrigerant usage in the equipment and potentially also reduce quantities leaking to the environment.

Being a pure, single-component refrigerant, R-32 can't lose its composition like a blended refrigerant and is well suited to retain its quality over time. It can be topped off and recharged in the field in both liquid and gas phases; because the composition doesn't change, it's easy to clean and reuse on site. R-32 can be reclaimed and recycled with a simple cleaning process, as compared to blends with less stable HFOs that must be distilled to their pure compounds and then remixed.

### Industry-Leading Performance

Industry-Leading Performance

Surpassing competitors with an exceptional EER of 11.0 and Class 6 air leakage rating at +/-6 static pressure, Rebel Applied outperforms traditional HVAC systems, achieving optimum cooling performance while consuming significantly less energy. These impressive ratings translate into substantial cost savings for commercial and industrial establishments, making it an ideal choice for reducing carbon footprint and expenses.

In addition, Rebel Applied's 20.0 IEER showcases its ability to provide unparalleled energy efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions. By considering different load levels and outdoor temperatures, this advanced system ensures optimal performance while maintaining a minimal energy footprint. It's this versatility that makes Rebel Applied suitable for diverse applications — from small office spaces to large-scale commercial buildings.

| Direct Expansion (DX) Heat Pump Rebel Applied’s DX heat pumps are highly energy-efficient. They utilize a refrigeration cycle to transfer heat from one space to another, leveraging the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environments. This process requires significantly less energy compared to traditional heating systems, such as electric resistance heaters or fossil fuel-based furnaces.

## ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

### Inverter Scroll Compressors

Daikin inverter compressors are designed to operate at variable speeds, making them energy-efficient. Unlike traditional compressors that operate at fixed speeds, inverter compressors can adjust their power output according to the cooling requirements. By continuously regulating the compressor's speed, they ensure that only the required amount of energy is consumed, resulting in significant energy savings. This not only lowers your electricity bills and reduces your carbon footprint, but it also delivers precision air temperature and humidity control, making it the environmentally friendly choice.

### Easy Retrofit

Rebel Applied's cutting-edge modular solution offers unparalleled flexibility, allowing you to design around the exact application. No more compromises or settling for less than perfection. With Rebel Applied, you have the power to tailor your retrofit project precisely to your needs.

Experience the ease of installation with our no-transition curb that ensures hassle-free integration into any setting, eliminating the need for costly modifications or extensive downtime. Seamlessly replace your Daikin units or competitor units with Rebel Applied, and witness the transformation firsthand.

### Unlimited Configurability

With a groundbreaking 37% shorter and 20% lighter design, Rebel Applied units enable flexible installation in tight spaces, making them an ideal choice for both new installations and retrofit projects. This compactness not only saves valuable real estate but also simplifies logistics and installation, leading to reduced project timelines and costs. The reduced weight minimizes structural requirements, allowing for easier rooftop placement and reducing installation complexities.

## ADVANTAGES/TECHNOLOGIES

## PUTTING THE IQ **IN IAQ**

Occupant and building material emissions are a common IAQ issue for buildings. CO2 generated by space occupants is a common driver of ventilation rates and is one of the most common building contaminants to be managed. Off-gassing from furniture, building materials and the like introduces volatile organic compounds, like formaldehyde, into the air. Daikin technologies for building contaminants focus on ventilation that maximizes effective clean air changes in the space with the lowest energy consumption.

### **Sorbent Ventilation Technology (SVT)**

SVT is tested in accordance with ASHRAE 145.2 to remove CO2, VOCs and other contaminants using sorbent filtration. When applied using ASHRAE 62.1's IAQ Procedure (IAQP), SVT provides cleaner air and reduces HVAC energy use by up to 30%.

Better Air: Promote better IAQ by removing building and occupancy related contaminants.

Retrofit Flexibility: Increase occupancy of served spaces without requiring increases in building infrastructure.

Energy Cost: Reduce outdoor air by up to 80% and save up to 30% in HVAC energy use.

Sustainability: By reducing HVAC energy use by up 30%, SVT offers a sustainable decarbonization solution that reduces indirect carbon emissions while enhancing building air quality.

### **Pathogen Mitigation**

### **PHOTO-CATALYTIC-OXIDATION**

UVGI photons react with a Titanium Oxide (TiO2) mesh panel to create a powerful oxidizing agent called a hydroxyl radical. As the air passes through the UVGI powered catalyst, the radicals oxidize gaseous organic compounds such as odors and VOCs, reducing them to trace compounds, CO2 and H2O. PCO systems are ideal where ventilation loads are driven by non-occupancy related emissions like casinos, airports, and office buildings.

### **FILTRATION**

Rebel Applied has configurable filtration with cartridge filters up to MERV 16 and HEPA final filters. High efficiency filtration is the number one way to reduce infection risk of airbourne pathogens.

### **ULTRA-VIOLET GERMICIDAL IRRADIATION**

Factory-mounted UV lights are available in coil cleaning intensity to keep coils clean of harmful microbial growth or airstream disinfection intensity to deactivate airbourne pathogens as they pass through the air tunnel.

### STANDBY

Standby for critical applications and processes is another efficient use for temporary rental equipment. A temporary system is sometimes used to back up manufacturing and chemical processes, or when a hospital's required system redundancy has been reduced.

#### SUPPLEMENTAL CAPACITY

When the demand of your facility or process exceeds your current system's capacity because of record-high temperatures or changes to cooling requirements, Daikin temporary rentals can be used to increase your heating or cooling output. By eliminating the need to purchase additional equipment that might be only used part of the year, you save on capital expenditures.
