# **Cabinet construction**

Daikin 6- to 10-ton horizontal units have a common cabinet size and common water, condensate, and duct connection locations for easier and more efficient installation. The cabinet is constructed of heavy-gauge G-60 galvanized steel. Large panels provide access to the fan/motor compartment and the compressor/control compartment. The interiors of the top and side panels and the bottom of the unit are covered with 1/2" thick, 1½ lb. dual-density fiberglass insulation. Closed-cell foam (IAQ) insulation is available as a selectable option, suitable for fiberglassfree applications. The filter is supported by a factorymounted combination filter rack and return air duct collar, eliminating the need for field-mounted brackets. The water and condensate connections protrude through the outside of the cabinet. The water connections are FPT type for easy connection to flexible hoses. The large condensate connection provides effective condensate removal. The electrical components are located in the compressor section of the unit. Holes are provided on the cabinet to facilitate main power and low voltage control wiring through separate holes. All wiring connections are made internal to the cabinet for maximum safety. Each unit is rated to accept time delay fuses for branch circuit and is protected by a resettable circuit breaker.

# **Refrigeration system**

Units have a dual circuit design and the two circuits operate independently to enable load shedding when conditions allow. Each circuit employs a random start feature to prevent both compressors from energizing simultaneously after an "unoccupied" cycle. Units contain two of each refrigerant system compo-

nent, including high efficiency compressors, coaxial heat exchanger with a copper inner tube and steel outer tube, reversing valves, expansion valves, high/low side refrigerant service valves, and required safety controls. Large access panels are provided for easy service access to any of these components.

The reversing valves are energized in the heating mode and will "fail-safe" to the cooling mode, which is the predominant mode of operation.

The air-to-refrigerant coil is a dual circuit coil on one slab. The fins are lanced and the tubes have finned edges on the inside to enhance heat transfer capabilities. Geothermal range units include coil and piping insulation to protect against condensation in low temperature geothermal applications.

Safety controls include low suction temperature (freezestat) and high pressure switches to lock out compressor operation at extreme conditions. The safety controls can only be reset from the main disconnect switch - not from the wall thermostat.

For additional safety, each unit has a low pressure switch to protect the compressor from low refrigerant charge. The low setting prevents nuisance trips while providing adequate protection.

# **Thermal expansion valve**

Units include a Thermal Expansion Valve (TXV) for refrigerant metering. The TXV allows the unit to operate at optimum efficiency with fluid temperatures ranging from 30ºF to 110ºF (geothermal capable units only) and entering air temperatures ranging from 55ºF to 90ºF. The TXV precisely meters the exact amount of refrigerant flow through the system to meet the load and deliver rated heating and cooling capacity.

# **Fan section**

The fan section includes the fan housing, fan wheel, fan motor, adjustable sheave, high strength V-belt, and drain pan. The standard drain pan is made of G-60 galvanized steel and is insulated from the cabinet. A stainless steel drain pan is available as an option. The pan has ample height to allow self-priming of the condensate trap. The fan motor is belt driven with an adjustable sheave for field adjustment. The motor is isolated from the fan housing to minimize vibration transmission to the cabinet. The fan housing protrudes through the cabinet to provide adequate material to connect to a field-provided flexible duct collar. The fan discharge can exit from the end or the side of the unit and must be configured at the factory.

# **Factory installed options**

Geothermal range units are available for applications requiring heating operation at reduced entering conditions. The geothermal range unit will operate at 25ºF (5ºC) minimum entering water temperature, 40ºF (5ºC) minimum entering air temperature.

The optional Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) provides adjustable speed control of a single fan motor. Factory installed internally in the cabinet fan section, the VFD provides not only a lower cost compared to field installation, but also an optimal installation location. The VFD is preprogrammed and includes a keypad for local or remote control.

# **Hot gas reheat coil**

For improved indoor climate control, Daikin Applied offers accurate and cost effective dehumidification control using a hot gas reheat coil. The hot gas reheat coil option is an excellent solution for applications where maintaining low humidity in a space is crucial. Once the space temperature is satisfied, the humidistat signal diverts the high temperature refrigerant gas to the reheat coil located downstream of the cooling coil. The conditioned and reheated air prevents over cooling of the space and maximizes moisture removal for improved indoor comfort. Under humid conditions (60%RH) and typical loop water temperatures, the latent capacity is optimized for approximately 90% of the sensible capacity. With loop water conditions of 85°F, the leaving air temperature is approximately the same as the entering air temperature, resulting in effective dehumidification without over cooling the space.

#### *Figure 1: CCH unit with hot gas reheat (HGRH)*

# **Waterside economizer**

The waterside economizer option helps to reduce energy consumption by using cool loop water temperatures to condition a space without energizing mechanical cooling. Even in the coldest weather a space can experience a build-up of ambient heat from people, equipment, lighting and the sun. Buildings with temperature controlled computer rooms, media/resource rooms or medical equipment rooms, benefit from the waterside economizer when the geothermal loop field or cooling tower temperatures are cool enough to provide air conditioning.

The waterside economizer includes a hydronic cooling coil located upstream of the unit's evaporator coil and after the filter. When entering water temperatures are between 35° to 70°F, a multi-stage thermostat or room temperature sensor in conjunction with a factory-installed entering water temperature sensor and a 2-position 3-way diverting valve, determines when loop water can be diverted to the hydronic coil for economizer cooling. The MicroTech III controller determines if the economizer or mechanical cooling will be utilized. The controller also provides low temperature protection to avoid economizer operation when entering water temperatures are below 35°F.

*Figure 2: CCH with waterside economizer coil option*

# **Hot gas bypass**

During cooling operation an external equalizer senses the suction pressure at the evaporator outlet. If the suction pressure drops below 115 psig the Hot Gas Bypass valve will begin to open and bypass hot discharge gas to the evaporator inlet, helping to prevent evaporator coil icing due to low suction pressure. The valve will continue to open as required to full capacity. As suction pressure rises to normal levels the HGBP valve will begin to close until normal cooling operation resumes.

# **Boilerless heat control (field installed)**

When the entering water temperature is below setpoint, the compressors will not be allowed to operate. On an initial call for heating, the fan and electric heat will start. When the room setpoint conditions are satisfied, electric heat will be de-energized and the fan will continue to operate at its "fan only" setting when enabled, for continuous fan operation. If fan cycling is enabled, the fan will turn off after 30 seconds once room setpoint conditions are satisfied.

# **MicroTech® III controller**

### **General use and information**

All Microtech III controller inputs must be operated by dry contacts powered by the control board's power terminals. No solid state devices (Triacs) may be used to operate the Microtech III controller inputs. No outside power source may be used to operate the Microtech III controller inputs.

The MicroTech III control system includes two microprocessor-based control boards conveniently located in the unit control box for easy access through a removable access panel. The standalone controls are a hard wired interface and provides all the necessary field connections. The board can be wired for 24-volt AC output to the wall thermostat by using terminals R & C. Two sets of LED annunciators are located on the front of the unit chassis to allow quick check of the unit operating status.

### **Standard sequence of operation**

Assumes cycle fan operation-not continuous fan operation:

- **Cooling mode** On an initial call for stage 1 cooling, the fan will energize and the 45 second flow timer will start. When the compressor minimum off, and random startup timers are expired, the unit will start in stage 1 cooling. If additional capacity is needed, the unit will initiate stage 2 cooling. When the room setpoint conditions are satisfied, the stage 2 compressor will shut off first followed by the stage 1 compressor. If fan cycling is enabled, the fan will turn off once room setpoint conditions are satisfied.
- **Heating mode** On an initial call for heating, the fan will energize, the pump request will energize, the 45 second flow timer will start. After the flow, compressor minimum off, and random startup timers are expired, the lead compressor will start at stage 1 heating settings; the reversing valve shall energize 5 seconds after the lead compressor turns on. If room setpoint conditions are not satisfied, the lag compressor will operate at stage 2 heating settings. When the room setpoint conditions are satisfied, the compressor will shut off. If fan cycling is enabled, the fan will turn off, once room setpoint conditions are satisfied.
- **■ Hot gas reheat with temperature control –** If the space temperature setpoint is satisfied, but the space humidity is above the humidity setpoint, the hot gas reheat mode is activated. The fan will energize, the pump request will energize, the 45 second flow timer will start, the compressor minimum off, and random startup timers expire, the hot gas reheat valve opens sending hot gas to the reheat coil, the stage 1 compressor energizes, and after 180 seconds the stage 2 compressor energizes. Return air is cooled and reheated to near space temperature. A call for cooling will close the hot gas reheat valve and the unit will resume normal cooling operation. If the space cooling and heating temperature setpoints are satisfied, but the humidity falls below the space humidity setpoint, the dehumidification mode is suspended.
- **Waterside economizer** This mode requires the optional factory-installed waterside economizer. A hydronic economizer coil, 3-way water valve and temperature sensor are added to the unit. The purpose of this mode is to satisfy some or all of the cooling demand by using the loop water, which is often reduced to 50°F or less via the cooling tower to achieve sufficient cooling performance. When a call for 1st stage cooling is engaged, with the entering loop water below the economizer changeover temperature, the H8 output on the MicroTech III board is activated to open the motorized valve allowing water flow to the equipment. The compressor is locked out, the 3-way water valve opens to allow cool loop water to flow through the economizer coil. The fan starts after 30 seconds (unless it is already on thru activation of the G terminal by the thermostat fan switch "on"). On a further demand for cooling, stage 2; the 1st compressor will start in the cooling mode. On a further demand for cooling the second compressor will energize. The waterside economizer mode will not be activated if the entering water temperature is below 35°F and an alarm (fault) signal will be generated. When the room setpoint conditions are satisfied, the compressor will shut off, the 3-way valve will close and the fan will either shut off (fan switch "auto") or continue to run (fan switch "on"). The minimum off timer of 360 seconds starts. If the loop temperature increases above the changeover temperature, waterside economizer mode will be suspended and the unit will resume normal mechanical cooling mode with stage 1 of the thermostat now starting the compressor.

### **Available operating modes**

**■ Unoccupied mode –** A simple "grounded" signal between terminals U and C (no power source required), puts the unit into the unoccupied mode for night setback operation.

### **Secondary heating modes (field installed)**

- **■** Supplementary electric heat control The supplemental electric heating option provides an additional stages of heating that can be used in conjunction with compressor heating, or exclusively if the compressor is not available for heating.
- **■** Boilerless electric heat mode When the entering water temperature is below setpoint, the compressors will not be allowed to operate. On an initial call for heating, the fan and electric heat will start. When the room setpoint conditions are satisfied, electric heat will be deenergized and the fan will continue to operate at its "fan only" setting when enabled, for continuous fan operation. If fan cycling is enabled, the fan will turn off after 30 seconds once room setpoint conditions are satisfied.

### **MicroTech III unit protections & LED fault status annunciation**

- **■ Short cycle protection & random start –** After power cycle or deactivation of certain alarms, or when leaving the unoccupied mode, a new random compressor startdelay time between 300 and 360 seconds is generated. The random start timer prevents compressors in different units from starting simultaneously. Compressor minimum OFF 360 sec) and compressor minimum ON (180 sec) timers prevent compressor short cycling.
- **■ Interstaging timer –** A default value of 5 minutes between staging of compressors, this feature minimizes short cycling of compressors and improves comfort.
- **■ Motorized valve/pump restart –** The IV/PR (H8) terminals on the The MicroTech III unit controller are used to energize (open) a motorized valve or start a water pump to get water circulating prior to starting the compressor on call for heating or cooling. Lead compressor operation shall be delayed a minimum of 45 seconds, after the motorized valve/isolation valve output energizes to allow for supply water flow.
- **■ Brownout protection –** The MicroTech III unit controller measures the input voltage and will suspend compressor and fan operation if the voltage falls below 80% of the unit nameplate rated value. Two external LED status are generated and an output is available to a "fault" LED at the thermostat.
- **■ Emergency unit shutdown** A simple grounded signal puts the unit into the shutdown mode. Remote shutdown is provided so that when properly connected to a water loop controller or remote switch, the emergency shutdown input can be used to shut down the water source heat pump. Compressor and fan operations are suspended, and an a unique two external LED status is generated.
- **■ Condensate overflow protection (cooling & dehumidification modes only)** – The MicroTech III unit controller incorporates a liquid sensor at the top of the drain pan. When the unit senses a high condensate water level for 60 consecutive seconds while in the cooling or dehumidification modes the unit enters the "Off Alarm" machine state. The dehumidification or cooling mode operation will immediately be de-energized as well as the pump output.
- **■ Thermostat fault reset (preferred method) –** A feature to reset some lockouts like high pressure and/or low temperature remote from the unit is available. When the cause of the fault condition has been fixed, repaired or resolved, the unit can be reset from the thermostat. To reset the fault, move the system switch on the thermostat from its current position (Heat/Auto/Cool) to the Off position and back to its original position two times within 30 seconds. The unit will now be reset. The intelligent reset counter and the 24 hour timer are cleared.

### **CAUTION**

Some thermostats have internal timers greater than 30 seconds that delay their switching capabilities. Defeating their internal timers may be required to reset the fault using the thermostat.

Alternatively, thermostats have an optional "reset" feature, by activating the reset feature and adding a wire from terminal O to terminal TB1, pin 4, on the MicroTech III board.

**■ Reset of automatic lockouts (alternate method) -** A feature to reset some lockouts like high pressure and/or low temperature at the unit is available. When the cause of the fault condition has been fixed, repaired or resolved, the unit can be reset at the unit. Apply a grounded signal to the tenant override input (screw terminal connection at TB1, pin 4) for a minimum of 10 seconds. The unit will now be reset. Alternatively, dropping power to the unit from the disconnect switch and re-applying power will reset the unit.

11------------------------------------------------



- **■ Intelligent alarm reset** The Intelligent Reset feature helps to minimize nuisance trips of automatic lockouts caused by low-temperature faults. This feature clears faults the first two times they occur within a 24-hour period and triggers an automatic lockout on the 3rd fault. The fault remains active until the alarm is manually cleared. At the end of the 24 hour period, all counts for that specific intelligent reset alarm are cleared to zero only if the occurrence counter is presently less than the value of three. The 24-hour period and alarm counts are stored in memory that is cleared when power is cycled.
- **■ Selectable lead compressor** The lead compressor selection provides a method to utilize circuit 2 if repairs are required on circuit 1. This is not intended for normal equipment operation. The jumper setting JP8 in the I/O expansion board is used to configure the "Lead Compressor" settings.

### **MicroTech III unit protections & LED fault status annunciation (continued)**

**■ Lead compressor fail replacement** – Upon detection of a lead compressor fault and the lag compressor is available, the selected lead compressor will be "failed replaced" by the lag compressor. Lead compressor will immediately be de-energized by ignoring the compressor minimum ON timer. Lag compressor will energize in place of the failed lead compressor, when the lag compressor minimum OFF timer has expired. Reversing valve for the lag compressor will be positioned, if necessary, 5 seconds after the lag compressor starts up.

- **■ Equipment protection control –** The MicroTech III controller receives separate input signals from the refrigerant high-pressure switch and the low suction line temperature sensor. In a high-pressure situation, compressor operation is suspended. In a low temperature situation, the unit goes into a defrost cycle where the unit is put into cooling operation for 60 seconds until the coaxial heat exchanger is free of ice. Each switch generates its own unique LED status.
- **■ Freeze fault protection option –** This factory-mounted option adds a leaving water temp, LWT, sensor to shut down compressor operation if the LWT gets too cold. It's a dual setting sensor, set for 35°F on boiler/tower and ground water applications (those with no anti-freeze) in the cooling & heating modes and geothermal applications in the cooling mode, or 13.5°F LWT on geothermal applications in the heating mode (those with antifreeze). **Caution:** If you move the jumper to the lower (geothermal) setting, there is a risk of freeze-up if there is no anti-freeze in the loop.

# **MicroTech® III controller with LonWorks® or BACnet® communication module**

The Large Horizontal Water Source Heat Pump can be equipped with a LonWorks or BACnet communication module. The LonWorks module is LonMark 3.4 certified and designed to communicate over a LonWorks communications network to a Building Automation System (BAS). The BACnet module is designed to communicate over a BACnet MS/TP communications network to a building automation system. Both controllers are microprocessor-based and can be factory or field-installed. The control modules are programmed and tested with all the logic required to monitor and control the unit. Optional wall sensors may be used with the communication modules to provide limited local control of the Horizontal Water Source Heat Pump. The MicroTech III controller monitors water and air temperatures and passes information to the communication module. The module communicates with the BAS, to provide network control of the Water Source Heat Pump.

# **MicroTech III LonWorks communication module**

The LonWorks communication module is designed for units that are integrated into a LonWorks communication network for centralized scheduling and management of multiple heat pumps.

# **Supply and return water hoses**

Available as fire rated construction in 2 or 3 foot (610 mm or 914 mm) lengths. Fire rated hoses have a synthetic polymer core with an outer rated covering of stainless steel. Fittings are steel. Assembly is "fire rated" and tested according to UL 94 with a VO rating and ASTM 84. Each hose has MPT connections. Hoses have a swivel connection at one end and are available in 1¼" (32 mm) to match the FPT fittings on unit sizes 072 through 120. See catalog 1196 for the complete hose and hose kit offering.

*Figure 4: Flexible, steel braided supply and return hoses*

### **Hose specifications**

Fire retardant TRP (Thermosplastic Rubber) tested to UL-94 with V-O rating.

### *Outer braid:*

Stainless steel wire (ANSI 302/304)

### *Temperature range:*

40°F to 200°F

# **Condensate hose kit**

Available as a long clear plastic hose with the necessary clamps and a MPT hose fitting for connection to the FPT field piping.

#### *Figure 5: Condensate hose kit*

# **Combination balancing and shutoff (ball) valves**

Constructed of brass and rated at 400 psig (2758 kPa) maximum working pressure. Valves have a built-in adjustable memory stop to eliminate rebalancing. Valves have FPT connections on both ends for connection to the water hose and to the field piping.

#### *Figure 6: Shut off ball valve*

# **Motorized valve**

Used in variable pumping type applications, the valve actuator is wired and typically piped in the return water line. The 2-way motorized water valve kit includes the valve body, actuator and wire harness. The 24VAC valve actuator must be wired directly to terminal block H8 on the MicroTech III controller. The valve will only energize on a call for heating or cooling. The 1-1/4" valve is rated for 300 psig (2068 kPa and the 1-1/2" valve is rated for 150 psig (1034 kPa).

# **Typical horizontal installation**

#### *Unit location*

It is important to leave enough space for service personnel to perform maintenance or repair. Locate the horizontal unit to allow for easy removal of the filter and access panels. Allow a minimum of 18" (46 cm) clearance on each side of the unit for service and maintenance access and do not install the unit above any piping. Always be sure to leave at least one side of the filter rack unobstructed so that the service personnel will be able to slide the filter out. Each unit is suspended from the ceiling by four 3/8" threaded rods fastened to the unit by a hanger bracket and rubber isolator. The design should place the unit directly below the structural members so that it is securely anchored.

#### *Figure 8: Unit clearances*

Avoid installing units directly above spaces where building occupants will reside (e.g. above office desks or classrooms) to reduce the requirement for noise attenuation. Do not place units above high traffic areas because service access may be limited during occupied hours. For example, units are typically installed above the hallway drop ceiling in Schools and the supply and return air is routed directly into classrooms. Local code may require fire dampers to be used with this application.

# **Piping**

The WSHP unit is typically connected to the supply/return piping using a "reverse return" piping system which includes a flow control device so that flow requirements are met for each zone. A short, high pressure "flexible hose" is used to connect the unit to the building's hard piping and acts as a sound attenuator for both the unit operating noise and hydraulic pumping noise. One end of the hose has a swivel fitting to facilitate removal of the unit for replacement or service. Include supply and return shutoff valves in the design to allow removal of a unit without the need to shut down the entire heat pump system. The return valve may be used for balancing and will typically have a "memory stop" so that it can be reopened to the proper position for the flow required.

#### *Figure 9: Typical ceiling installation*

Fixed flow devices are commercially available and can be installed to eliminate the need for memory stop shut off valves. Include Pressure / Temperature ports to allow the service technician to measure water flow and unit operation.

# **Condensate drain piping**

Condensate piping can be made of steel, copper or PVC pipe. In most cases, PVC pipe eliminates the need to wrap insulation around the pipe to prevent sweating. A threaded, factory supplied condensate fitting allows the connection of PVC, flexible vinyl hose or steel braided hose. The condensate piping must be trapped at the unit and pitched away from the unit not less than 1/4" per foot. A vent is required after the trap so that the condensate will drain away from the unit. The vent can also act as a clean out if the trap becomes clogged. To avoid having waste gases entering the building, the condensate drain should not be directly piped to a drain/waste/vent stack. See local codes for the correct application of condensate piping to drains.

17------------------------------------------------



# **Ductwork and attenuation**

Ductwork is normally applied to ceiling-mounted heat pumps on the discharge side of the unit. A discharge collar is provided on all horizontal unit models for fastening the ductwork. Use a flexible connector between the discharge collar and the duct transformation to help reduce vibration transmission from the cabinet and to simplify disconnection of the unit from the ceiling ductwork. If return ductwork is to be used, attach a flexible connector to the filter rack collar to help reduce vibration transmission and removal of the unit. Return plenum ducting should be at least 12 inches away from the coil so that the coil is evenly loaded with return air.

As a general recommendation, duct interiors should have an acoustic / thermal lining at least 1/2 inch thick over the entire duct run. For better sound attenuation, line the last five diameters of duct before each register with a one-inch thick sound blanket. Elbows, tees and dampers can create turbulence or distortion in the

airflow. Place a straight length of duct, 5 to 10 times the duct width, before the next fitting to smooth out airflow. Diffusers that are located in the bottom of a trunk duct can also produce noise. For this same reason, volume control dampers should be located several duct widths upstream from an air outlet.

For Hotel, Motel, Dormitory or Nursing Home applications that use a single duct discharge, a velocity of 500 to 600 fpm is suggested. These applications typically have static pressures as low as 0.05 inches of water and duct lengths approximately six feet in length. The discharge duct must be fully lined and have a square elbow without turning vanes. Return air for these applications should enter through a "low" sidewall filter grille and route up the stud space to a ceiling plenum. For horizontal heat pumps mounted from the ceiling, an insulated return plenum is sometimes placed at the return air opening to further attenuate line-of-sight sound transmission through return openings.

# **Typical cooling and heating refrigeration cycles – dual compressors**

*Figure 13: Cooling refrigeration cycle*

*Figure 14: Heating refrigeration cycle*

When the wall thermostat calls for HEATING, the reversing valve (energized) directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil (condenser). There, the heat is removed by the air passing over the surfaces of the coil and the hot gas condenses and becomes a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (evaporator). The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the water. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

*Note: Typical temperature readings are at full load conditions at ISO-13256 for boiler-tower applications.*

# **Typical hot gas reheat refrigeration cycle – dual compressors**

When the DEHUMID setting is not satisfied and COOLING has been satisfied the reversing valve remains (de-energized) but the hot gas reheat (HGRH) valve is (energized). This directs the flow of the refrigerant, a hot gas, from the compressor through the hot gas reheat (HGRH) coil thus heat is removed from the refrigerant gas to reheating the cooled air from the evaporator coil. Then the refrigerant flows to the water-torefrigerant heat exchanger (coaxial heat exchanger). There, the heat is removed by the water, and the hot gas condenses to become a liquid. The liquid then flows through a thermal expansion valve to the air-to-refrigerant heat exchanger coil (evaporator). The liquid then evaporates and becomes a gas, at the same time absorbing heat and cooling the air passing over the surfaces of the coil. The refrigerant then flows as a low pressure gas through the reversing valve and back to the suction side of the compressor to complete the cycle.

## **Systems**

Water source heat pump systems are one of the most efficient, environmentally friendly systems available for heating and cooling buildings. High-efficiency, self contained units (sizes 7,000 btuh to 290,000 btuh) can be placed in virtually any location within a building. Each unit responds only to the heating or cooling load of the individual zone it serves. This permits an excellent comfort level for occupants, better control of energy use for building owners and lower seasonal operating costs. The Air-Conditioning Refrigeration Institute (ARI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) publish standards so that water source heat pumps are rated for specific applications. The ARI/ISO loop options shown in this catalog are typical water source heat pump loop choices available in today's market. These systems offer benefits ranging from low cost installation to the highest energy efficiency available in the market today.

### **Boiler / tower applications: AHRI 320 / ISO 13256-1**

A "Boiler/Tower" application uses a simple two-pipe water circulating system that adds heat, removes heat or transfers rejected heat to other units throughout the building. The water temperature for heating is generally maintained between 65ºF – 70ºF and is usually provided by a natural gas or electric boiler located in a mechanical room. The condensing water temperature, during cooling months, is maintained between 85ºF and 95ºF and requires the use of a cooling tower to dissipate waste heat. Cooling towers can be located on the roof, or inside or adjacent to the building. This application can be the lowest cost of the loop options available.

Note: ASHRAE 90.1 standards require that circulating pumps over 10 HP will require use of "variable frequency drive" equipment and pipe insulation to be used whenever water temperatures are below 60 degrees and above 105 degrees. See ASHRAE 90.1 Standards for details.

#### *Figure 16: Boiler/tower application*

### **Open loop well water applications: AHRI 325 / ISO 13256-1**

"Open Loop" well water systems use ground water to remove or add heat to the interior water loop. The key benefit of an open loop system is the constant water temperature, usually 50ºF to 60ºF, which provides efficient operation at a low first cost. Most commercial designers incorporate a heat exchanger to isolate the building loop from the well water. Using heat exchangers can reduce maintenance issues while still allowing the transfer of heat from unit to unit as with the "Boiler/ Tower System". A successful design provides an ample amount of groundwater (approximately 2 GPM per ton) and adequate provisions for discharging water back to the aquifer or surface. Open Loop applications are commonly used in coastal areas where soil characteristics allow reinjection wells to return the water back to the aquifer. Note that some states have requirements on the depths of return water reinjection wells, and such wells must be approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Also, bad water quality can increase problems with heat exchanger scaling. Suspended solids can erode the heat exchanger. Strainers can be used to contain suspended solids.

#### *Figure 17: Open loop well application*

21------------------------------------------------



### **Closed loop geothermal applications: AHRI 330/ISO 13256-1**

"Vertical Closed Loop" applications are installed by drilling vertical bore holes into the earth and inserting a plastic polyethylene supply/return pipe into the holes. The vertical wells are connected in parallel reverse return fashion to allow the water from the building to circulate evenly throughout the bore field. The circulating fluid dissipates heat to the ground in a similar manner as a "tower" and adds heat back to the loop like a boiler. If properly designed, the loop field can maintain the loop temperatures necessary to condition the building without the use of a boiler or a tower. Loop temperatures usually range from 37ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern applications can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. The number of bore holes and their depth should be determined by using commercial software that is specifically designed for vertical geothermal applications. Typical bore depths of a vertical loop range from 150 to 400 feet and generally require about 250 feet of surface area per ton of cooling.

#### *Figure 18: Vertical loop application*

A closed loop "Horizontal" geothermal application is similar to a vertical loop application with the exception that the loops are installed in trenches approximately 5 feet below the ground surface. The piping may be installed using a "four-pipe" or "six-pipe" design and could require 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of surface area per ton of cooling. Loop temperatures for a commercial application can range from 35ºF to 95ºF in Northern climates. Southern climates can see temperatures ranging from 40ºF to 100ºF. Horizontal loops are generally not applied in urban areas because land use and costs can be prohibitive. New advances in installation procedures have improved the assembly time of horizontal loops while keeping the first cost lower than a vertical loop.

*Figure 19: Horizontal loop application*

A "Surface Water" or "Lake" closed loop system is a geothermal loop that is directly installed in a lake or body of water that is near the building. In many cases, the body of water is constructed on the building site to meet drainage or aesthetic requirements. Surface loops use bundled polyethylene coils that are connected in the same manner as a vertical or horizontal loop using a parallel reverse return design. The size and the depth of the lake is critical. Commercial design services should be used to certify that a given body of water is sufficient to withstand the building loads. Loop temperatures usually range from 35ºF to 90ºF and prove to be the best cooling performer and lowest cost loop option of the three geothermal loops. Some applications may not be good candidates due to public access or debris problems from flooding.

# **Operating limits**


*Table 11: Typical water source heat pump common design temperatures*

*Table 12: Water source heat pump operating temperature limits (for continuous duty)*


*Notes: 1.In the heating mode, the sum of the entering air + entering water must be ≥ 100°F.*

*2.MINIMUM WATER FLOW = 1.5 GPM/Ton.*

*3.Maximum and minimum values may not be combined. If one value is at maximum or minimum, the other two conditions may not exceed the normal condition for standard units. Geothermal range units may combine any two maximum conditions, but not more than two, with all other conditions being normal conditions.*

#### *Table 13: Water source heat pump operating temperature limits at start-up (not for continuous duty)*


### **Standard range units:**

Units are designed to start in an ambient of 50°F (10°C) with entering air at 50°F (10°C), with entering water at 50°F (10°C), with nominal air flow and water flow (3.0 GPM/Ton), for initial start-up in heating.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

### **Geothermal range units:**

Units are designed to start in an ambient of 40°F (5°C) with entering air at 40°F (5°C), with entering water at 20°F (-7°C), with nominal air flow and water flow (3.0 GPM/Ton), for initial start-up in heating.

*Note: This is not a normal or continuous operating condition. It is assumed that such start-up is for the purpose of bringing the building space up to occupancy temperature.*

### **Environment**

This equipment is designed for indoor installation only. Sheltered locations such as attics, garages, etc., generally will not provide sufficient protection against extremes in temperature and/or humidity, and equipment performance, reliability, and service life may be adversely affected.

### **Power supply**

A voltage variation of +/-10% of nameplate voltage is acceptable. Three-phase system imbalance shall not exceed 2%.
